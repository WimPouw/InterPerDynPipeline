## Overview
This is a start of the sample code for a Open-source Standardized Pipeline for Tracing the Behavioral Dynamics in Social Interaction. In this repo we have sample data that we can work with to build our pipelines, which will then be rolled out on the full longitudinal dataset.

## Contact
If you want to be added to the github as a collaborator ask wim.pouw@donders.ru.nl with your github username.

## To Do's
- make time series more robust against tracking errors
- add object tracking pipeline, using improved SAM2?
- determine time series features that further need to be extracted
- determine step 3 time series analysis for understanding interpersonal dynamics
- masking and final tracking of the full dataset
- merge (some) steps into single pipeline
