# Website for our Quarto Extended Methods
https://wimpouw.github.io/InterPerDynPipeline/

## Overview
This is a start of the sample code for a Open-source Standardized Pipeline for Tracing the Behavioral Dynamics in Social Interaction. In this repo we have sample data that we can work with to build our pipelines, which will then be rolled out on the full longitudinal dataset.

## Contact
If you want to be added to the github as a collaborator ask wim.pouw@donders.ru.nl with you github username.

## To Do's
- make time series more robust against tracking errors
- add object tracking pipeline, using improved SAM2?
- determine time series features that further need to be extracted
- determine step 3 time series analysis for understanding interpersonal dynamics
- masking and final tracking of the full dataset
- merge (some) steps into single pipeline

## Smoothness flat data
We also generate for each session smoothness measures. Thus the data is flat, for each session a feature.

# Smoothness Metrics in Flat Data

The smoothness analysis calculates log dimensionless squared jerk (DSJ) for various movement trajectories to quantify motion smoothness. Lower DSJ values indicate smoother. The values are log-transformed to normalize their distribution.

### Distance-Based Smoothness
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `smoothness_distancecom` | Smoothness of center-of-mass distance between people |
| `smoothness_distancecentroid` | Smoothness of centroid distance between people |

### Position-Based Smoothness
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `smoothness_xy_average_com_p1` | Average smoothness of Person 1's COM movement (x,y axes) |
| `smoothness_xy_average_com_p2` | Average smoothness of Person 2's COM movement (x,y axes) |
| `smoothness_xy_average_centroid_p1` | Average smoothness of Person 1's centroid movement (x,y axes) |
| `smoothness_xy_average_centroid_p2` | Average smoothness of Person 2's centroid movement (x,y axes) |

### Approach/Avoidance Smoothness
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `smoothness_p1_proximity` | Smoothness of Person 1's approach/avoidance behavior |
| `smoothness_p2_proximity` | Smoothness of Person 2's approach/avoidance behavior |

### Additional Metrics
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `videoID` | Unique identifier for the session recording |
| `samples` | Number of frames/samples in the recording |
| `perc_twopersonsdetected` | Percentage of frames where both people were detected |
| `average_com_movementp1` | Average movement magnitude of Person 1's center of mass |
| `average_com_movementp2` | Average movement magnitude of Person 2's center of mass |

The dimensionless squared jerk calculation involves several processing steps:
1. Interpolation to handle missing data
2. Velocity, acceleration and jerk calculation with Savitzky-Golay filtering
3. Integration to determine movement amplitude and integrated squared jerk
4. Calculation of dimensionless metric so that it is normalized for movement duration and movement amplitude
5. Log transformation

## Processing Pipeline
1. **Video Tracking (STEP 1)**
   - Input: Raw video files
   - Process: YOLO-based person tracking
   - Output: Tracked keypoints data

2. **Time Series Generation (STEP 2)**

   - Process: 
     - Distance calculations
     - Speed computations
     - Signal smoothing (One Euro Filter)
   - Output: Processed time series data

*Note: Due to size limitations, video files over 100MB are stored somewhere else.*
