Accordingly, we offer guidance on how to produce, test, and use theory by answering the following questions: (1) Why is theory so critical and for whom? (2) What does a good theory look like? (3) What does it mean to have too much or too many theories? (4) When don't we need a theory? (5) How does falsification work with theory? and (6) Is good theory compatible with current publication pressures? Our answers are useful to current and future scholars and journal editors and reviewers, as well as consumers of research including other researchers, organization decision makers, and policy makers, and other stakeholders in the theory production and testing process including deans and other university administrators.},

On average, 14 sibling pairs with Mexican Indigenous-heritage backgrounds engaged together collaboratively as an ensemble, making decisions in common and fluidly building on each other's ideas, more often than 16 middle-class European American sibling pairs, who on average more often divided decision making into a solo activity (often ignoring the other or simply bossing the other). Siblings who spent more time collaborating fluidly as an ensemble in the shared planning task were also more likely to collaborate with initiative at home, according to their mothers, which suggests that family socialization practices may contribute to cultural differences in collaboration.},

This book provides a straightforward introduction to scientific methods for observing social behavior. Because of the importance of time in the dynamics of social interaction, sequential approaches to analyzing and understanding social behavior are emphasized. An advanced knowledge of statistical analysis is not required. Instead, the authors present fundamental concepts and offer practical advice.},

Traditionally, movement smoothness has been computed mainly for discrete movements, in particular arm, reaching and circle drawing, using kinematic data. There are currently very few studies investigating smoothness of rhythmic movements, and there is no systematic way of analysing the smoothness of such movements. There is also very little work on the smoothness of other movement related variables such as force, impedance etc. In this context, this paper presents the first step towards a unified framework for the analysis of smoothness of arbitrary movements and using various data. It starts with a systematic definition of movement smoothness and the different factors that influence smoothness, followed by a review of existing methods for quantifying the smoothness of discrete movements. A method is then introduced to analyse the smoothness of rhythmic movements by generalising the techniques developed for discrete movements. We finally propose recommendations for analysing smoothness of any general sensorimotor behaviour.},

The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates.

  abstract = {Principles of a dynamic, dyadic systems view of mother-infant face-to-face communication, which considers self- and interactive processes in relation to one another, were tested. The process of interaction across time in a large low-risk community sample at infant age 4 months was examined. Split-screen videotape was coded on a 1-s time base for communication modalities of attention, affect, orientation, touch, and composite facial-visual engagement. Time-series approaches generated self- and interactive contingency estimates in each modality. Evidence supporting the following principles was obtained: (a) Significant moment-to-moment predictability within each partner (self-contingency) and between the partners (interactive contingency) characterizes mother-infant communication. (b) Interactive contingency is organized by a bidirectional, but asymmetrical, process: Maternal contingent coordination with infant is higher than infant contingent coordination with mother. (c) Self-contingency organizes communication to a far greater extent than interactive contingency. (d) Self- and interactive contingency processes are not separate; each affects the other in communication modalities of facial affect, facial-visual engagement, and orientation. Each person's self-organization exists in a dynamic, homoeostatic (negative feedback) balance with the degree to which the person coordinates with the partner. For example, those individuals who are less facially stable are likely to coordinate more strongly with the partner's facial affect and vice versa. Our findings support the concept that the dyad is a fundamental unit of analysis in the investigation of early interaction. Moreover, an individual's self-contingency is influenced by the way the individual coordinates with the partner. Our results imply that it is not appropriate to conceptualize interactive processes without simultaneously accounting for dynamically interrelated self-organizing processes.},

All of the available evidence suggests that the societies of our Pliocene ancestors were like those of other social primates, and this means that human psychology has changed in ways that support larger, more cooperative societies that characterize modern humans. In this paper, we argue that cultural adaptation is a key factor in these changes. Over the last million years or so, people evolved the ability to learn from each other, creating the possibility of cumulative, cultural evolution. Rapid cultural adaptation also leads to persistent differences between local social groups, and then competition between groups leads to the spread of behaviours that enhance their competitive ability. Then, in such culturally evolved cooperative social environments, natural selection within groups favoured genes that gave rise to new, more pro-social motives. Moral systems enforced by systems of sanctions and rewards increased the reproductive success of individuals who functioned well in such environments, and this in turn led to the evolution of other regarding motives like empathy and social emotions like shame.},

Construct validity refers to inferences made at both stages of research linking concepts to operations. The chapter uses the concept of demand characteristics to illustrate the difference between methodological confounds (which affect construct validity) and methodological artifacts. Construct validity represents one form of generalizing from the observed results of an empirical study to conclusions that go beyond the results themselves. The debate includes discussions of whether there are necessary trade-offs among the various aspects of validity or whether it is possible to demand that research maximize internal, external, and construct validity simultaneously.},

This paper explores the transformation of psychological testing and assessment in the context of digital footprints and the rise of machine learning (ML) tools. The emergence of smartphones, wearables, and social media platforms has allowed for the collection of passive data, significantly impacting how psychological states are evaluated. This shift offers enhanced insights into personality traits and psychological symptoms, while reducing reliance on traditional self-report methods. However, the use of machine learning to interpret large volumes of behavioral data raises concerns about ethical implications, particularly regarding privacy, consent, and algorithmic transparency. Furthermore, methodological challenges, such as the reliability and validity of AI-based assessments, complicate the integration of these tools into mainstream psychological practice. This paper aims to critically evaluate the benefits and limitations of digital footprints and ML in psychological assessment, emphasizing the need for ethical frameworks and robust methodologies to ensure their effective and safe implementation.

  abstract = {This paper describes the R package crqa to perform cross-recurrence quantification analysis of two time series of either a categorical or continuous nature. Streams of behavioral information, from eye movements to linguistic elements, unfold over time. When two people interact, such as in conversation, they often adapt to each other, leading these behavioral levels to exhibit recurrent states. In dialog, for example, interlocutors adapt to each other by exchanging interactive cues: smiles, nods, gestures, choice of words, and so on. In order for us to capture closely the goings-on of dynamic interaction, and uncover the extent of coupling between two individuals, we need to quantify how much recurrence is taking place at these levels. Methods available in crqa would allow researchers in cognitive science to pose such questions as how much are two people recurrent at some level of analysis, what is the characteristic lag time for one person to maximally match another, or whether one person is leading another. First, we set the theoretical ground to understand the difference between ``correlation'' and ``co-visitation'' when comparing two time series, using an aggregative or cross-recurrence approach. Then, we describe more formally the principles of cross-recurrence, and show with the current package how to carry out analyses applying them. We end the paper by comparing computational efficiency, and results' consistency, of crqa R package, with the benchmark MATLAB toolbox crptoolbox (Marwan, 2013). We show perfect comparability between the two libraries on both levels.},

  abstract = {The availability of smart devices has made it possible to collect intensive longitudinal data (ILD) from individuals, providing a unique opportunity to study the complex dynamics of psychological systems. Existing time-series methods often have limitations, such as assuming linear interactions or having restricted forms, leading to difficulties in capturing the complex nature of these systems. To address this issue, we introduce fitlandr, a method with implementation as an R package that integrates nonparametric estimation of the drift-diffusion function and stability landscape. The drift-diffusion function is estimated using the multivariate kernel estimator (MVKE; Bandi \& Moloche, 2018), and the stability landscape is estimated through Monte-Carlo estimation of the steady-state distribution (Cui et al., 2021; Cui, Lichtwarck-Aschoff, et al., 2023). Using a simulated emotional system, we demonstrate that fitlandr can effectively recover bistable dynamics from data, even in the presence of moderate noise, and that it primarily relies on dynamic information from the system instead of distributional information. We then apply the method to two empirical single-participant experience sampling method data sets and compared the results with the simulation data sets. Whereas both data sets show a bimodal distribution, fitlandr only revealed bistability in one of them, indicating that bimodality in ILD does not necessarily imply the existence of bistability in the underlying system. These results demonstrate the potential of fitlandr as a tool for uncovering the rich, nonlinear dynamics of psychological systems from ILD.

We build on findings that in a number of Indigenous American communities, fluid and harmonious collaboration is prioritized both in community organization at a scale of years and centuries, and in everyday family interactions and researcher-\- organized tasks at a scale of days, hours, or minutes. We examined whether this sophisticated fluid collaboration could be seen even at a scale of fractions of seconds. At a microscale of 200-\-millisecond segments, Guatemalan Mayan triads of mothers and children frequently engaged mutually, in fluid synchrony together, when exploring novel objects. They did so more commonly than did European American mother-\-child triads, who usually engaged solo or in dyads, with one person left out, or resisted each other. This microanalysis of mutuality in family interactions reveals the role of culture in the foundations of thinking and working together in both Mayan and European American communities, and the fruitfulness of considering developmental processes holistically.},

As these systems are increasingly being deployed in high-stakes real-world applications, there is a dire need to ensure that they do not propagate or amplify any discriminatory tendencies in historical or human-curated data or inadvertently learn biases from spurious correlations. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on fairness that summarizes and sheds light on ongoing trends and successes in the context of computer vision. The topics we discuss include 1) The origin and technical definitions of fairness drawn from the wider fair machine learning literature and adjacent disciplines. 2) Work that sought to discover and analyze biases in computer vision systems. 3) A summary of methods proposed to mitigate bias in computer vision systems in recent years. 4) A comprehensive summary of resources and datasets produced by researchers to measure, analyze, and mitigate bias and enhance fairness. 5) Discussion of the field's success, continuing trends in the context of multimodal foundation and generative models, and gaps that still need to be addressed. The presented characterization should help researchers understand the importance of identifying and mitigating bias in computer vision and the state of the field and identify potential directions for future research.},

These AI algorithms inherit different biases from humans due to mysterious operational flow and because of that it is becoming adverse in usage. As a result, researchers have started to address the issue by investigating deeper in the direction towards Responsible and Explainable AI. Among variety of applications of AI, facial expression recognition might not be the most important one, yet is considered as a valuable part of human-AI interaction. Evolution of facial expression recognition from the feature based methods to deep learning drastically improve quality of such algorithms. This research work aims to study a gender bias in deep learning methods for facial expression recognition by investigating six distinct neural networks, training them, and further analysed on the presence of bias, according to the three definition of fairness. The main outcomes show which models are gender biased, which are not and how gender of subject affects its emotion recognition. More biased neural networks show bigger accuracy gap in emotion recognition between male and female test sets. Furthermore, this trend keeps for true positive and false positive rates. In addition, due to the nature of the research, we can observe which types of emotions are better classified for men and which for women. Since the topic of biases in facial expression recognition is not well studied, a spectrum of continuation of this research is truly extensive, and may comprise detail analysis of state-of-the-art methods, as well as targeting other biases.},

This article outlines methodological considerations and the decision-making process for measurement selection for child behavior, parenting/caregiver-child interactions, and the family/home environment for HBCD. The decision-making process is detailed, including formation of a national workgroup (WG-BEH) that focused on developmentally appropriate measures that take a rigorous and equitable approach and aligned with HBCD objectives. Multi-level-observational and caregiver-report measures were deemed necessary for capturing the desired constructs across multiple contexts while balancing the nuance of observational data with pragmatic considerations. WG-BEH prioritized developmentally sensitive, validated assessments with psychometrics supporting use in diverse populations and focused on mechanistic linkages and prediction of desired constructs. Other considerations included participant burden and retention, staff training needs, and cultural sensitivity. Innovation was permitted when it was grounded in evidence and filled key gaps. Finally, this article describes the rationale for the selected constructs (e.g., temperament, social-emotional development, parenting behaviors, family organization) and corresponding measures chosen for HBCD visits from early infancy through 17 months of age.},

Here, we address this question with respect to joint activity and social behavior via an explication of Guy Van Orden's formulation of interaction-dominant dynamics and his provocative discussion of the ``blue collar brain.'' Using these 2 concepts we argue that human social behavior and performance is not controlled by a cascade of fast timescale activity (i.e., neural processes or individual action) but rather emerges from the modulated enslavement of faster timescale processes by much slower dynamical processes, such as shared task outcomes and socially defined historical context. We detail this argument by reviewing 2 recent behavioral findings that we believe provide evidence that the dynamics of human performance during a socially situated activity is interaction dominant. The first concerns the behavioral coordination that emerges during a novel joint-action collision-avoidance task. The second concerns the effects of stereotype threat on an individual's cognitive performance. Finally, we discuss how identifying the role that the slower timescale dynamics of social events and structures plays in shaping complex behavioral dynamics can guide future research on joint-action and human performance.},

Nonetheless, it may result in significant discrimination if not handled properly as CV systems highly depend on the data they are fed with and can learn and amplify biases within such data. Thus, the problems of understanding and discovering biases are of utmost importance. Yet, there is no comprehensive survey on bias in visual datasets. Hence, this work aims to: i) describe the biases that might manifest in visual datasets; ii) review the literature on methods for bias discovery and quantification in visual datasets; iii) discuss existing attempts to collect bias-aware visual datasets. A key conclusion of our study is that the problem of bias discovery and quantification in visual datasets is still open, and there is room for improvement in terms of both methods and the range of biases that can be addressed. Moreover, there is no such thing as a bias-free dataset, so scientists and practitioners must become aware of the biases in their datasets and make them explicit. To this end, we propose a checklist to spot different types of bias during visual dataset collection.},

While classical approaches are largely based on models of individual linguistic processing, recent advances stress the social coordinative nature of dialog. In the influential interactive alignment model, dialogue is thus approached as the progressive entrainment of interlocutors' linguistic behaviors toward the alignment of situation models. Still, the driving mechanisms are attributed to individual cognition in the form of automatic structural priming. Challenging these ideas, we outline a dynamical framework for studying dialog based on the notion of interpersonal synergy. Crucial to this synergetic model is the emphasis on dialog as an emergent, self-organizing, interpersonal system capable of functional coordination. A consequence of this model is that linguistic processes cannot be reduced to the workings of individual cognitive systems but must be approached also at the interpersonal level. From the synergy model follows a number of new predictions: beyond simple synchrony, good dialog affords complementary dynamics, constrained by contextual sensitivity and functional specificity. We substantiate our arguments by reference to recent empirical studies supporting the idea of dialog as interpersonal synergy. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)},

The discussion of attrition and nonignorable missingness emphasizes the need for longitudinal diagnostics and for reducing the uncertainty about the missing data mechanism under attrition. Strategies suggested for reducing attrition bias include using auxiliary variables, collecting follow-up data on a sample of those initially missing, and collecting data on intent to drop out.

  abstract = {Multimodal communication research focuses on how different means of signalling coordinate to communicate effectively. This line of research is traditionally influenced by fields such as cognitive and neuroscience, human-computer interaction, and linguistics. With new technologies becoming available in fields such as natural language processing and computer vision, the field can increasingly avail itself of new ways of analyzing and understanding multimodal communication. As a result, there is a general hope that multimodal research may be at the ``precipice of greatness'' due to technological advances in computer science and resulting extended empirical coverage. However, for this to come about there must be sufficient guidance on key (theoretical) needs of innovation in the field of multimodal communication. Absent such guidance, the research focus of computer scientists might increasingly diverge from crucial issues in multimodal communication. With this paper, we want to further promote interaction between these fields, which may enormously benefit both communities. The multimodal research community (represented here by a consortium of researchers from the Visual Communication [ViCom] Priority Programme) can engage in the innovation by clearly stating which technological tools are needed to make progress in the field of multimodal communication. In this article, we try to facilitate the establishment of a much needed common ground on feasible expectations (e.g., in terms of terminology and measures to be able to train machine learning algorithms) and to critically reflect possibly idle hopes for technical advances, informed by recent successes and challenges in computer science, social signal processing, and related domains.},

We explain how the inclusion of machine learning in the social sciences requires us to rethink not only applications of machine learning methods but also best practices in the social sciences. In contrast to the traditional tasks for machine learning in computer science and statistics, when machine learning is applied to social scientific data, it is used to discover new concepts, measure the prevalence of those concepts, assess causal effects, and make predictions. The abundance of data and resources facilitates the move away from a deductive social science to a more sequential, interactive, and ultimately inductive approach to inference. We explain how an agnostic approach to machine learning methods focused on the social science tasks facilitates progress across a wide range of questions.},

It was a demonstration event at the 2018 Asian Games and was discussed as a potential addition to the Olympic program at the 2018 Esports Forum, organized by the International Olympic Committee. Even so, the status of esports remains a highly disputed topic in academia. In this paper, we argue that to be promoted as a full-fledged sport esports has to be associated with talents and health benefits similar to traditional sports. Existing studies indicate that traditional team sports and amateur gaming are both related to cognitive advantages. To evaluate the extent of this similarity at the professional level, we assessed perceptual-cognitive abilities of (semi-)professional esports players (N\,=\,31) and professional soccer and basketball players (N\,=\,43). Esports players and athletes performed equally well in complex tests measuring attentional control, short-term and working spatial memory span, attention distribution, reaction time, and hand-eye coordination. Esports players outperformed athletes in the speed of visual search. This data supports the idea that esports and traditional team sports demand a similar level of perceptual-cognitive ability from professionals and might provide similar cognitive benefits.},

  abstract = {Conversation between two people involves subtle nonverbal coordination in addition to speech. However, the precise parameters and timing of this coordination remain unclear, which limits our ability to theorize about the neural and cognitive mechanisms of social coordination. In particular, it is unclear if conversation is dominated by synchronization (with no time lag), rapid and reactive mimicry (with lags under 1 s) or traditionally observed mimicry (with several seconds lag), each of which demands a different neural mechanism. Here we describe data from high-resolution motion capture of the head movements of pairs of participants (n\,=\,31 dyads) engaged in structured conversations. In a pre-registered analysis pathway, we calculated the wavelet coherence of head motion within dyads as a measure of their nonverbal coordination and report two novel results. First, low-frequency coherence (0.2--1.1 Hz) is consistent with traditional observations of mimicry, and modeling shows this behavior is generated by a mechanism with a constant 600 ms lag between leader and follower. This is in line with rapid reactive (rather than predictive or memory-driven) models of mimicry behavior, and could be implemented in mirror neuron systems. Second, we find an unexpected pattern of lower-than-chance coherence between participants, or hypo-coherence, at high frequencies (2.6--6.5 Hz). Exploratory analyses show that this systematic decoupling is driven by fast nodding from the listening member of the dyad, and may be a newly identified social signal. These results provide a step towards the quantification of real-world human behavior in high resolution and provide new insights into the mechanisms of social coordination.},

Since increased longevity retards development and expands brain size across the mammals, this hypothesis links our slower developing, bigger brains to ancestral grandmothering. If foraging interdependence favoured postmenopausal longevity because grandmothers' subsidies reduced weaning ages, then ancestral infants lost full maternal engagement while their slower developing brains were notably immature. With survival dependent on social relationships, sensitivity to reputations is wired very early in neural ontogeny, beginning our lifelong preoccupation with shared intentionality.

  abstract = {How our collective intelligence has helped us to evolve and prosper Humans are a puzzling species. On the one hand, we struggle to survive on our own in the wild, often failing to overcome even basic challenges, like obtaining food, building shelters, or avoiding predators. On the other hand, human groups have produced ingenious technologies, sophisticated languages, and complex institutions that have permitted us to successfully expand into a vast range of diverse environments. What has enabled us to dominate the globe, more than any other species, while remaining virtually helpless as lone individuals? This book shows that the secret of our success lies not in our innate intelligence, but in our collective brains---on the ability of human groups to socially interconnect and learn from one another over generations. Drawing insights from lost European explorers, clever chimpanzees, mobile hunter-gatherers, neuroscientific findings, ancient bones, and the human genome, Joseph Henrich demonstrates how our collective brains have propelled our species' genetic evolution and shaped our biology. Our early capacities for learning from others produced many cultural innovations, such as fire, cooking, water containers, plant knowledge, and projectile weapons, which in turn drove the expansion of our brains and altered our physiology, anatomy, and psychology in crucial ways. Later on, some collective brains generated and recombined powerful concepts, such as the lever, wheel, screw, and writing, while also creating the institutions that continue to alter our motivations and perceptions. Henrich shows how our genetics and biology are inextricably interwoven with cultural evolution, and how culture-gene interactions launched our species on an extraordinary evolutionary trajectory. Tracking clues from our ancient past to the present, The Secret of Our Success explores how the evolution of both our cultural and social natures produce a collective intelligence that explains both our species' immense success and the origins of human uniqueness.},

  abstract = {Behavioral scientists routinely publish broad claims about human psychology and behavior in the world's top journals based on samples drawn entirely from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. Researchers---often implicitly---assume that either there is little variation across human populations, or that these ``standard subjects'' are as representative of the species as any other population. Are these assumptions justified? Here, our review of the comparative database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations and that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species---frequent outliers. The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral reasoning, reasoning styles, selfconcepts and related motivations, and the heritability of IQ. The findings suggest that members of WEIRD societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans. Many of these findings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior---hence, there are no obvious a priori grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing questions of human nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity. We close by proposing ways to structurally re-organize the behavioral sciences to best tackle these challenges.},

One reason for this state of affairs is that different measures have been used with different scaling factors. These measures are sensitive to movement amplitude and/or duration to different degrees. We show that jerk-based measures with dimensions vary counter-intuitively with movement smoothness, whereas a dimensionless jerk-based measure properly quantifies common deviations from smooth, coordinated movement.},

  abstract = {Reflexivity is the act of examining one's own assumption, belief, and judgement systems, and thinking carefully and critically about how these influence the research process. The practice of reflexivity confronts and questions who we are as researchers and how this guides our work. It is central in debates on objectivity, subjectivity, and the very foundations of social science research and generated knowledge. Incorporating reflexivity in the research process is traditionally recognized as one of the most notable differences between qualitative and quantitative methodologies. Qualitative research centres and celebrates the participants' personal and unique lived experience. Therefore, qualitative researchers are readily encouraged to consider how their own unique positionalities inform the research process and this forms an important part of training within this paradigm. Quantitative methodologies in social and personality psychology, and more generally, on the other hand, have remained seemingly detached from this level of reflexivity and general reflective practice. In this commentary, we, three quantitative researchers who have grappled with the compatibility of reflexivity within our own research, argue that reflexivity has much to offer quantitative methodologists. The act of reflexivity prompts researchers to acknowledge and centre their own positionalities, encourages a more thoughtful engagement with every step of the research process, and thus, as we argue, contributes to the ongoing reappraisal of openness and transparency in psychology. In this paper, we make the case for integrating reflexivity across all research approaches, before providing a `beginner's guide' for quantitative researchers wishing to engage reflexively with their own work, providing concrete recommendations, worked examples, and reflexive prompts.},

We frame equitable teacher--child interactions as the combination of generic and cultural aspects, and as a way to utilize the social assets of Latinos in classrooms to enhance their academic development. We refine an observation protocol---the Classroom Assessment of Sociocultural Interactions (CASI)---by integrating cultural concepts from the Learning by Observing and Pitching In (LOPI) paradigm with videos of K-1 classrooms in Central Mexico, and conduct a series of psychometric analyses.

Therefore the presentation of the Western middle-class developmental pathway in textbooks as universal is grossly neglecting the reality and the psychologies of the majority of the world' s population. First, the conception of culture as the representation of environmental conditions is presented. The level of formal education acts as organizer of social milieus that define different learning environments for children. Mainly two developmental pathways are portrayed: the Western middle-class trajectory and the traditional farmer childhood. Different developmental principles are highlighted, demonstrating systematic cultural differences in the development of a conception of the self: developmental dynamics as exemplified in early mother infant interactions, the timing of developmental milestones emphasizing cultural precocities in motor development and self-recognition, developmental gestalts in different attachment relationships and precursors and consequences demonstrating that different, sometimes contradictory behavioral patterns have the same developmental consequences with the examples of empathy development and autobiographical memory. It is argued that evaluating the development in one pathway with the principles and standards of the other is unscientific and unethical. The recognition of different developmental pathways is a necessity for basic science and a moral obligation for the applied fields.},

As a result, bias-mitigation research efforts have mainly focused on tackling gender and racial disparities, while other demographic related biases, such as age, have seen less progress. This work seeks to examine the performance of state of the art commercial FER technology on expressive images of men and women from three distinct age groups. We utilize four different commercial FER systems in a black box methodology to evaluate how six emotions - anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutrality, and sadness - are correctly detected by age group. We further investigate how algorithmic changes over the last year have affected system performance. Our results found that all four commercial FER systems most accurately perceived emotion in images of young adults and least accurately in images of older adults. This trend was observed for analyses conducted in 2019 and 2020. However, little to no gender disparities were observed in either year. While older adults may not have been the initial target consumer of FER technology, statistics show the demographic is quickly growing more keen to applications that use such systems. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering various demographic subgroups during FER system validation and the need for inclusive, intersectional algorithmic developmental practices.},

This makes doing reflexivity a challenging endeavor, particularly for those new to using qualitative methodologies. This article explores reflexivity as a form of critical thinking and evaluation by demarcating reflexive activity in relation to other forms of critical thinking used in psychology. Using notions of perspectival location, we shed some practical light on the objectives and processes of reflexivity, from its significance in the identification of a research topic, through designing, conducting, and writing the research report. The overarching question of ``what is the point of reflexivity?'' is answered through an interrogation of common assumptions around producing ``good'' research in psychology as well as through a series of key questions illuminating different steps in the research process. We conclude that reflexivity requires the unpacking of partial, positioned and affective perspectives we bring to the research. This process facilitates our questioning and moves us beyond our own taken-for-granted assumptions and sense-making of the social world.},

Yet, while competition may indeed have an impact on performance, little is known about competition-related psychophysical stress responses in esports. Accordingly, this review aims to investigate whether playing esports in competitive (and non-competitive) settings is related to psychological and/or physiological stress. Design A systematic literature review was performed. Study inclusion criteria included: assessment of psychological and/or physiological stress in esports, study of healthy individuals over 12 years of age, and published in peer-reviewed journals in English or German. Method The literature search comprised EBSCOhost, PubMed, and Web of Science up until August 2019. An additional search was performed on Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Sponet. Results Seventeen studies met inclusion criteria. In publications investigating the non-competitive setting, it can be assumed that merely playing esports games is unrelated to psychophysiological stress reactions. While three out of five studies on stress in competitive settings demonstrated no hormonal reaction, one study reported an increase in anxiety levels in winners as well as an increase cortisol levels from baseline to postgame conditions, and two studies found an activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Overall, the studies revealed theoretical and methodological limitations, which are discussed in the present review. Conclusions Although the existing literature contributes to an initial understanding of psychophysiological stress in esports, further in-depth studies of stress responses in actual competition are needed.},

They highlight ethical, legal, and social issues that emerge when digital technologies are employed in psychological science research in the current era of rapid technological change, increasing prevalence of interdisciplinary team science, evolving understandings of ethical precepts and social norms, and promoting open science. This introduction to the special issue provides an overview of challenges to the Belmont principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice revealed in the 10 articles. The conclusions reached are that these ethical principles do not always adapt well to the digital environment and that practices cannot always be uniquely classified under one of these three headings. We recommend that conceptual work and practical guidance be undertaken to expand the interpretation of these principles in the light of evolving societal norms and emerging ethical issues.

  abstract = {Social interactions are pervasive in human life with varying forms of interpersonal coordination emerging and spanning different modalities (e.g. behaviors, speech/language, and neurophysiology). However, during social interactions, as in any dynamical system, patterns of coordination form and dissipate at different scales. Historically, researchers have used aggregate measures to capture coordination over time. While those measures (e.g. mean relative phase, cross-correlation, coherence) have provided a wealth of information about coordination in social settings, some evidence suggests that multiscale coordination may change over the time course of a typical empirical observation. To address this gap, we demonstrate an underutilized method, windowed multiscale synchrony, that moves beyond quantifying aggregate measures of coordination by focusing on how the relative strength of coordination changes over time and the scales that comprise social interaction. This method involves using a wavelet transform to decompose time series into component frequencies (i.e. scales), preserving temporal information and then quantifying phase synchronization at each of these scales. We apply this method to both simulated and empirical interpersonal physiological and neuromechanical data. We anticipate that demonstrating this method will stimulate new insights on the mechanisms and functions of synchrony in interpersonal contexts using neurophysiological and behavioral measures.},

The MediaPipe framework addresses all of these challenges. A developer can use MediaPipe to build prototypes by combining existing perception components, to advance them to polished cross-platform applications and measure system performance and resource consumption on target platforms. We show that these features enable a developer to focus on the algorithm or model development and use MediaPipe as an environment for iteratively improving their application with results reproducible across different devices and platforms.

HLM and its discrete outcome extensions, however, are certainly not the only methods available to model clustered data. Although other methods exist and are widely implemented in other disciplines, it seems that psychologists have yet to consider these methods in substantive studies. This article compares and contrasts HLM with alternative methods including generalized estimating equations and cluster-robust standard errors. These alternative methods do not model random effects and thus make a smaller number of assumptions and are interpreted identically to single-level methods with the benefit that estimates are adjusted to reflect clustering of observations. Situations where these alternative methods may be advantageous are discussed including research questions where random effects are and are not required, when random effects can change the interpretation of regression coefficients, challenges of modeling with random effects with discrete outcomes, and examples of published psychology articles that use HLM that may have benefitted from using alternative methods. Illustrative examples are provided and discussed to demonstrate the advantages of the alternative methods and also when HLM would be the preferred method.

Given the close association between esports activities and cognition, esports holds promise in offering new perspectives for understanding cognitive expertise. This meta-analysis aims at quantitatively delineating the cognitive disparities between esports experts and amateurs. Methods The expert group comprised professional video game players and high-ranking players (top 1\%), while amateurs were assigned to the control group. Research studies published between January 2000 and December 2023 were systematically searched in databases. A three-level model with cluster-robust variance estimation was used to calculate the overall effect size. The moderating variables included professional level, cognitive abilities, dependent variable type, game genre, gender and age. Results A total of 15 studies containing 142 effect sizes and 1085 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The results indicated that, compared to amateurs, video game experts demonstrated superior cognitive abilities with a small effect size (Hedges' g = 0.373, 95\% CI [0.055--0.691], p = .012). The differences between experts and amateur players mainly manifest in spatial cognition and attention. Sensitivity analysis, risk of bias, and publication bias results indicated the reliability of these findings. Conclusions This meta-analysis confirms that esports experts possess superior cognitive abilities compared to amateurs, particularly in aspects of spatial cognition and attention. These can provide an effective reference for future selection and training in esports.},

  abstract = {Ethnographic literature indicates that in many cultural communities around the world, children have extensive opportunities to learn through observing and participating in their community's work and other mature activities. We argue that in communities in which children are often segregated from adult work (as in middle-class European American communities), young children instead are often involved in specialised child-focused activities such as lessons, adult--child play (and scholastic play), and conversation with adults on child-related topics.             We examine this argument with systematic time-sampled observations of the extent of 2- to 3-year-old children's access to adult work compared to their involvement in specialised child-focused activities. Observations focused on 12 children in each of four communities: two middle-class European American communities (West Newton, Massachusetts and Sugarhouse, Utah), Efe foragers of the Democratic Republic of Congo, and indigenous Maya of San Pedro, Guatemala. West Newton and Sugarhouse children had less frequent access to work and were involved more often in specialised child-focused activities than Efe and San Pedro children.             The results support the idea that the middle-class European American children's frequent involvement in specialised child-focused activities may relate to their more limited opportunities to learn through observing work activities of their communities. It may be less necessary for the Efe and San Pedro children to be involved in specialised child-focused activities to prepare them for involvement in mature community practices, because they are already a regular part of them.},

Recent work has shown that, in contrast to nonhuman primates, human children focus more on reproducing the specific actions used than on achieving actual outcomes when learning by imitating. From 18 months of age, children will routinely copy even arbitrary and unnecessary actions. This puzzling behavior is called overimitation. By documenting similarities exhibited by children from a large, industrialized city and children from remote Bushman communities in southern Africa, we provide here the first indication that overimitation may be a universal human trait. We also show that overimitation is unaffected by the age of the child, differences in the testing environment, or familiarity with the demonstrating adult. Furthermore, we argue that, although seemingly maladaptive, overimitation reflects an evolutionary adaptation that is fundamental to the development and transmission of human culture.},

The present study describes the development of the dyadic coordination of vocalization and gaze behavior between mothers and infants over the first year of life. In addition to describing developmental trajectories of behavior, the study contributes to our understanding of dyadic coordination by investigating how different measures of coordination relate to one another and how individual behaviors relate to dyadic coordination within the vocal and gaze domains. Thirty dyads were recorded playing together with a standard set of toys when infants were 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age, and mother and infant vocalization and gaze behaviors were coded from these videos on a moment-to-moment basis. Coordination was analyzed using both cross-recurrence quantitative analysis and event-based measures of analysis. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine developmental trajectories of vocalization and gaze coordination. Results indicated that dyadic coordination of the timing of vocalization and gaze behaviors is a very early emerging phenomenon that is supported by both mothers and infants. Vocal coordination did not show developmental change over time, whereas mothers and infants became increasingly coordinated in their gaze behaviors as infants got older. Taken together, findings from this study highlight the importance of considering bidirectional and developmental influences on parent and infant behavior.

  abstract = {Observational methods in psychology research are crucial for gathering accurate data about human and animal behaviors, especially given the inherent challenges in human observation. These methods aim to reduce perceptual distortions and biases that can compromise the objectivity necessary for scientific inquiry. Initially emphasized by early behaviorists like John B. Watson, the focus switched from subjective mental processes to observable behaviors, thereby enhancing the reliability of observational studies. Researchers employ techniques such as behavioral taxonomies---structured categories that define and classify behaviors---to ensure observations are clear and consistent. This process involves a habituation period, during which subjects become accustomed to the observer's presence, allowing for more natural behavior to be recorded. Validity and reliability checks, such as interobserver agreement, are essential to ensure that the defined categories accurately reflect the behaviors being studied. While observational methods provide valuable insights into behavior, they also highlight the limitations of human perception, which can influence various fields beyond psychology, such as law. The understanding that eyewitness accounts are often flawed underscores the need for caution when interpreting observational data. As this field continues to advance, there is a trend towards using automated tools to enhance objectivity and accuracy in observations.},

By integrating this tool within research practices, we aim to enhance data reproducibility and utility in social science research. Our approach draws on Design Science Research, proposing that MaskAnyone can facilitate safer data sharing and potentially reduce the storage of fully identifiable data. We discuss the development and capabilities of MaskAnyone, explore its integration into ethical research practices, and consider the broader implications of audio-visual data masking, including issues of consent and the risk of misuse. The paper concludes with a preliminary evaluation framework for assessing the effectiveness and ethical integration of masking tools in such research settings.},

Consequently, data sharing in fields such as behavioral science, multimodal communication, and human movement research is often limited. In addition, in legal and other non-scientific contexts, privacy-related concerns may preclude the sharing of video recordings and thus remove the rich multimodal context that humans recruit to communicate. Minimizing the risk of identity exposure while preserving critical behavioral information would maximize utility of public resources (e.g., research grants) and time invested in audio--visual\hspace{0pt} research. Here we present an open-source computer vision tool that masks the identities of humans while maintaining rich information about communicative body movements. Furthermore, this masking tool can be easily applied to many videos, leveraging computational tools to augment the reproducibility and accessibility of behavioral research. The tool is designed for researchers and practitioners engaged in kinematic and affective research. Application areas include teaching/education, communication and human movement research, CCTV, and legal contexts.},

In this work, I first give a brief overview of the previous literature surrounding video games and cognition. I next address the critical methodological problems such as measuring expertise based solely through time-on-task as a heuristic of expertise rather than true metrics of skilled performance itself. I then suggest how the burgeoning sub-domain of competitive video gaming, or ``eSports,'' provides an elegant solution to these problems. Finally, I discuss the current and future directions of eSports cognition research.},

Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is far less likely to predict false detections where nothing exists. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms all other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, by a wide margin when generalizing from natural images to artwork on both the Picasso Dataset and the People-Art Dataset.},

Facial analysis, one application of artificial intelligence, is increasingly used in real-word situations. For example, some organizations tell candidates to answer predefined questions in a recorded video and use facial recognition to analyze the potential applicant faces. In addition, some companies are developing facial recognition software to scan the faces in crowds and assess threats, specifically mentioning doubt and anger as emotions that indicate threats.  This study provides evidence that facial recognition software interprets emotions differently based on the person's race. Using a publically available data set of professional basketball players' pictures, I compare the emotional analysis from two different facial recognition services, Face   and Microsoft's Face API. Both services interpret black players as having more negative emotions than white players; however, there are two different mechanisms. Face   consistently interprets black players as angrier than white players, even controlling for their degree of smiling. Microsoft registers contempt instead of anger, and it interprets black players as more contemptuous when their facial expressions are ambiguous. As the players' smile widens, the disparity disappears. This finding has implications for individuals, organizations, and society, and it contributes to the growing literature of bias and/or disparate impact in AI.},

  abstract = {Measuring the quality of movement is a need and a challenge for clinicians. Jerk, defined as the quantity of acceleration variation, is a kinematic parameter used to assess the smoothness of movement. We aimed to assess and compare jerk metrics in asymptomatic participants for 3 important movement characteristics that are considered by clinicians during shoulder examination: dominant and non-dominant side, concentric and eccentric contraction mode, and arm elevation plane. In this pilot study, we measured jerk metrics by using Xsens{\textregistered} inertial measurement units strapped to the wrists for 11 different active arm movements (ascending and lowering phases): 3 bilateral maximal arm elevations in sagittal, scapular and frontal plane; 2 unilateral functional movements (hair combing and low back washing); and 2 unilateral maximal arm elevations in sagittal and scapular plane, performed with both arms alternately, right arm first. Each arm movement was repeated 3 times successively and the whole procedure was performed 3 times on different days. The recorded time series was segmented with semi-supervised algorithms. Comparisons involved the Wilcoxon signed rank test (p \&lt; 0.05) with Bonferroni correction. We included 30 right-handed asymptomatic individuals [17 men, mean (SD) age 31.9 (11.4) years]. Right jerk was significantly less than left jerk for bilateral arm elevations in all planes (all p \&lt; 0.05) and for functional movement (p \&lt; 0.05). Jerk was significantly reduced during the concentric (ascending) phase than eccentric (lowering) phase for bilateral and unilateral right and left arm elevations in all planes (all p \&lt; 0.05). Jerk during bilateral arm elevation was significantly reduced in the sagittal and scapular planes versus the frontal plane (both p \&lt; 0.01) and in the sagittal versus scapular plane (p \&lt; 0.05). Jerk during unilateral left arm elevation was significantly reduced in the sagittal versus scapular plane (p \&lt; 0.05). Jerk metrics did not differ between sagittal and scapular unilateral right arm elevation. Using inertial measurement units, jerk metrics can well describe differences between the dominant and non-dominant arm, concentric and eccentric modes and planes in arm elevation. Jerk metrics were reduced during arm movements performed with the dominant right arm during the concentric phase and in the sagittal plane. Using IMUs, jerk metrics are a promising method to assess the quality of basic shoulder movement.},

Pairs from both backgrounds spent nearly a third of the time during a computer programming activity building on each other's ideas through making and responding to proposals. However in addition, Mexican American pairs spent another third of the time coordinating in fluid synchrony, anticipating each other's contributions without proposals. This accounts for their averaging twice as much collaboration overall than the European American children, who spent more time resisting their partner's con\- tributions, negotiating whose idea to use, and bossing their partner.},

This is the first systematic, quantitative study of children's social environment and practice in this Indigenous community. The results show that the practices of the Yurakare people are based on two things: (1) inclusion of all ages in community life, which cultivates children to engage in useful activities even while having fun; (2) the primacy of mature activities, which is in line with the LOPI model.},

There is little agreement about what constitutes strong versus weak theory in the social sciences, but there is more consensus that references, data, variables, diagrams, and hypotheses are not theory. Despite this consensus, however, authors routinely use these five elements in lieu of theory. We explain how each of these five elements can be confused with theory and how to avoid such confusion. By making this consensus explicit, we hope to help authors avoid some of the most common and easily averted problems that lead readers to view papers as having inadequate theory. We then discuss how journals might facilitate the publication of stronger theory. We suggest that if the field is serious about producing stronger theory, journals need to reconsider their empirical requirements. We argue that journals ought to be more receptive to papers that test part rather than all of a theory and use illustrative rather than definitive data.},

Becoming Human looks instead to development and reveals how those things that make us unique are constructed during the first seven years of a child's life.In this groundbreaking work, Michael Tomasello draws from three decades of experimental research with chimpanzees, bonobos, and children to propose a new framework for psychological growth between birth and seven years of age. He identifies eight pathways that differentiate humans from their primate relatives: social cognition, communication, cultural learning, cooperative thinking, collaboration, prosociality, social norms, and moral identity. In each of these, great apes possess rudimentary abilities, but the maturation of humans' evolved capacities for shared intentionality transform these abilities into uniquely human cognition and sociality.``How does human psychological growth run in the first seven years, in particular how does it instill `culture' in us? ...Most of all, how does the capacity for shared intentionality and self-regulation evolve in people?

Classically, children come to understand beliefs, including false beliefs, at about 4--5 y of age, but recent studies using different response measures suggest that even infants (and apes!) have some skills as well. Resolving this discrepancy is not possible with current theories based on individual cognition. Instead, what is needed is an account recognizing that the key processes in constructing an understanding of belief are social and mental coordination with other persons and their (sometimes conflicting) perspectives. Engaging in such social and mental coordination involves species-unique skills and motivations of shared intentionality, especially as they are manifest in joint attention and linguistic communication, as well as sophisticated skills of executive function to coordinate the different perspectives involved. This shared intentionality account accords well with documented differences in the cognitive capacities of great apes and human children, and it explains why infants and apes pass some versions of false-belief tasks whereas only older children pass others.},

Participation in such activities requires not only especially powerful forms of intention reading and cultural learning, but also a unique motivation to share psychological states with others and unique forms of cognitive representation for doing so. The result of participating in these activities is species-unique forms of cultural cognition and evolution, enabling everything from the creation and use of linguistic symbols to the construction of social norms and individual beliefs to the establishment of social institutions. In support of this proposal we argue and present evidence that great apes (and some children with autism) understand the basics of intentional action, but they still do not participate in activities involving joint intentions and attention (shared intentionality). Human children's skills of shared intentionality develop gradually during the first 14 months of life as two ontogenetic pathways intertwine: (1) the general ape line of understanding others as animate, goal-directed, and intentional agents; and (2) a species-unique motivation to share emotions, experience, and activities with other persons. The developmental outcome is children's ability to construct dialogic cognitive representations, which enable them to participate in earnest in the collectivity that is human cognition.},

They then challenge this status quo by inviting readers to recognize that dynamics, context-specificity, interconnectedness, and uncertainty, are a natural and exciting part of human psychology -- these are not things to be avoided and feared, but instead embraced. This requires a shift toward a process-based approach that recognizes the situated, time-dependent, and fundamentally processual nature of psychological phenomena. With complex dynamic systems as a framework, this book sketches out how we might move toward a process-based praxis that is more suitable and effective for understanding human functioning.},

This phenomenon can occur in various forms such as matching rhythmic movements, aligning speech patterns, or synchronizing biological rhythms. It plays a crucial role in social interactions, effective communication, sports, and musical performance. This work aims to reference accessible online datasets related to human synchronization, to increase their visibility and availability. Notably, it compiles 75 directly accessible datasets and 26 with indirect access to study synchronization in various contexts. It reviews all types of synchronization tasks and contexts found in the datasets. Results are clustered into four categories: discontinuous movement, continuous movement, social interactions, and musical performance. Then, this review explores the signals and acquisition methods used across human synchronization datasets, ranging from simple touchpads, and kinematic sensors, to expansive motion capture and hyperscanning technologies. This paper surveys objective measures of synchronization used in the gathered papers and reveals some heterogeneity in the quantification of synchronization. Furthermore, it points out a lack of annotated datasets, which limits the development of machine learning methods. By compiling accessible datasets, this review centralizes valuable experimental data, providing a foundation for more collaborative, comprehensive, and standardized approaches to studying human synchronization.},

  abstract = {During development we transition from coregulation (where regulatory processes are shared between child and caregiver) to self-regulation. Most early coregulatory interactions aim to manage fluctuations in the infant's arousal and alertness; but over time, coregulatory processes become progressively elaborated to encompass other functions such as sociocommunicative development, attention and executive control. The fundamental aim of coregulation is to help maintain an optimal `critical state' between hypo- and hyperactivity. Here, we present a dynamic framework for understanding child--caregiver coregulatory interactions in the context of psychopathology. Early coregulatory processes involve both passive entrainment, through which a child's state entrains to the caregiver's, and active contingent responsiveness, through which the caregiver changes their behaviour in response to behaviours from the child. Similar principles, of interactive but asymmetric contingency, drive joint attention and the maintenance of epistemic states as well as arousal/alertness, emotion regulation and sociocommunicative development. We describe three ways in which active child--caregiver regulation can develop atypically, in conditions such as Autism, ADHD, anxiety and depression. The most well-known of these is insufficient contingent responsiveness, leading to reduced synchrony, which has been shown across a range of modalities in different disorders, and which is the target of most current interventions. We also present evidence that excessive contingent responsiveness and excessive synchrony can develop in some circumstances. And we show that positive feedback interactions can develop, which are contingent but mutually amplificatory child--caregiver interactions that drive the child further from their critical state. We discuss implications of these findings for future intervention research, and directions for future work.},

  abstract = {Indigenous nations and communities in the United States have rights as sovereign governments to exercise control and ownership over all data and information generated by or from the tribes, tribal members, or tribal resources. Indigenous nations exercise these rights through data ownership policies established in response to unethical research practices in research involving Indigenous communities. Most universities in the U.S. have ``openness in research'' policies to ensure academic freedom to publish freely, exercised by retaining university control of data. Here, we describe our study of cultural ecosystem services in the St. Louis River estuary region (Nagaajiwanaang in the language Ojibwemowin) in Duluth, Minnesota, and Superior, Wisconsin, U.S., an area that includes portions of the 1854 and 1842 Ceded Territories and reservation lands of a local band of Ojibwe (hereafter referred to as ``the Band''). In this university-led, Band-supported study, both the university and the Band sought ownership of data collected based on their respective policies, resulting in a research delay of nearly a year. We found that open research policies that do not consider Indigenous sovereignty can hamper collaboration between university researchers and tribal nations, even when there is broad agreement on research goals and objectives. University open research policies that do not explicitly address Indigenous sovereignty fall short of the open research principles they intend to support and should be revised. Formal adoption of principles for ethical research with sovereign tribal governments by universities is needed to improve coordination and trust among university and tribal researchers and members.},

  abstract = {Humans are able to collaborate with a large number of people in order to create and accomplish feats that were previously only imaginable. This chapter enacts the phenomenon of collaborative creativity through a mathematical characterization of coordination dynamics in terms of transfer entropy and prediction decay. It uses extant datasets from a dyadic mirror game and study on musical improvisation. The chapter provides a comparison of coordination dynamics in two improvisational settings: a movement-based improvisation known as the mirror game and a dyadic musical improvisation on a digital keyboard. Although it investigates coordination in two empirical dyadic contexts, it sets the stage for further work that can scale up to larger groups. To do so, the chapter employs methods that can apply to multiple data modalities and that prior work has applied beyond the dyadic (or bivariate) level. It envisions that the key to this is understanding interpersonal coordination in terms of information flow and signal predictability. The chapter concludes with a discussion of some unanswered questions to set the stage for future research that investigates the role of coordination dynamics in collaborative and creative contexts.

  abstract = {During collaborative problem solving (CPS), coordination occurs at different spatial and temporal scales. This multiscale coordination should play a functional role in facilitating effective collaboration. To evaluate this, we conducted a study of computer-based CPS with 42 dyadic teams. We used cross-wavelet coherence to examine movement coordination, extracted from videos, at several scales, and tested whether the observed coordination was greater than expected due to chance and due to task demands. We found that coordination at scales less than 2s was greater than chance and at most scales (except 16s, 1m, and 2m), was greater than expected due to task demands. Lastly, we observed that coherence at .25s and 1s scales was predictive of performance. However, when including relative phase, our results suggest that higher in-phase movement coordination at the 1s scale was the strongest predictor of CPS performance. Further, we used growth curve modeling to examine how movement coordination changes across the duration of the task and whether this is moderated by CPS performance. We found that coordination over the duration of the CPS task is quadratic (a U shape) and that better performing teams have higher coordination with a shallower curve. We discuss these findings and their relevance to understanding how low-level movement coordination facilitates CPS.},

It has drawn increasing attention during the past decade and has been utilized in a wide range of applications including human-computer interaction, motion analysis, augmented reality, and virtual reality. Although the recently developed deep learning-based solutions have achieved high performance in human pose estimation, there still remain challenges due to insufficient training data, depth ambiguities, and occlusion. The goal of this survey article is to provide a comprehensive review of recent deep learning-based solutions for both 2D and 3D pose estimation via a systematic analysis and comparison of these solutions based on their input data and inference procedures. More than 260 research papers since 2014 are covered in this survey. Furthermore, 2D and 3D human pose estimation datasets and evaluation metrics are included. Quantitative performance comparisons of the reviewed methods on popular datasets are summarized and discussed. Finally, the challenges involved, applications, and future research directions are concluded. A regularly updated project page is provided: .},
