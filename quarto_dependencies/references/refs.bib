  abstract = {To the complex question of ``What is the number one issue on which we should focus as producers, evaluators, and consumers of research?'' our simple and blunt answer is: It's the theory, stupid. Accordingly, we offer guidance on how to produce, test, and use theory by answering the following questions: (1) Why is theory so critical and for whom? (2) What does a good theory look like? (3) What does it mean to have too much or too many theories? (4) When don't we need a theory? (5) How does falsification work with theory? and (6) Is good theory compatible with current publication pressures? Our answers are useful to current and future scholars and journal editors and reviewers, as well as consumers of research including other researchers, organization decision makers, and policy makers, and other stakeholders in the theory production and testing process including deans and other university administrators.},

Research performed for the purpose of demonstration is conducted to establish empirically the existence of a phenomenon or relationship. The tripartite distinction between internal, external, and construct validity, provides the basis for organizing the discussion of validity issues. Construct validity refers to inferences made at both stages of research linking concepts to operations. The chapter uses the concept of demand characteristics to illustrate the difference between methodological confounds (which affect construct validity) and methodological artifacts. Construct validity represents one form of generalizing from the observed results of an empirical study to conclusions that go beyond the results themselves. The debate includes discussions of whether there are necessary trade-offs among the various aspects of validity or whether it is possible to demand that research maximize internal, external, and construct validity simultaneously.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the R package crqa to perform cross-recurrence quantification analysis of two time series of either a categorical or continuous nature. Streams of behavioral information, from eye movements to linguistic elements, unfold over time. When two people interact, such as in conversation, they often adapt to each other, leading these behavioral levels to exhibit recurrent states. In dialog, for example, interlocutors adapt to each other by exchanging interactive cues: smiles, nods, gestures, choice of words, and so on. In order for us to capture closely the goings-on of dynamic interaction, and uncover the extent of coupling between two individuals, we need to quantify how much recurrence is taking place at these levels. Methods available in crqa would allow researchers in cognitive science to pose such questions as how much are two people recurrent at some level of analysis, what is the characteristic lag time for one person to maximally match another, or whether one person is leading another. First, we set the theoretical ground to understand the difference between ``correlation'' and ``co-visitation'' when comparing two time series, using an aggregative or cross-recurrence approach. Then, we describe more formally the principles of cross-recurrence, and show with the current package how to carry out analyses applying them. We end the paper by comparing computational efficiency, and results' consistency, of crqa R package, with the benchmark MATLAB toolbox crptoolbox (Marwan, 2013). We show perfect comparability between the two libraries on both levels.},

  abstract = {The availability of smart devices has made it possible to collect intensive longitudinal data (ILD) from individuals, providing a unique opportunity to study the complex dynamics of psychological systems. Existing time-series methods often have limitations, such as assuming linear interactions or having restricted forms, leading to difficulties in capturing the complex nature of these systems. To address this issue, we introduce fitlandr, a method with implementation as an R package that integrates nonparametric estimation of the drift-diffusion function and stability landscape. The drift-diffusion function is estimated using the multivariate kernel estimator (MVKE; Bandi \& Moloche, 2018), and the stability landscape is estimated through Monte-Carlo estimation of the steady-state distribution (Cui et al., 2021; Cui, Lichtwarck-Aschoff, et al., 2023). Using a simulated emotional system, we demonstrate that fitlandr can effectively recover bistable dynamics from data, even in the presence of moderate noise, and that it primarily relies on dynamic information from the system instead of distributional information. We then apply the method to two empirical single-participant experience sampling method data sets and compared the results with the simulation data sets. Whereas both data sets show a bimodal distribution, fitlandr only revealed bistability in one of them, indicating that bimodality in ILD does not necessarily imply the existence of bistability in the underlying system. These results demonstrate the potential of fitlandr as a tool for uncovering the rich, nonlinear dynamics of psychological systems from ILD.

Here, caregiver-infant dyads (N=222, 2-6-months- old, all female caregivers) in South Africa and Malawi engaged in naturalistic play before their interactions were hand-annotated to measure caregiver predictability and infant gaze. In both countries, temporal variation in caregiver predictability shaped infant looking dynamics---infants attended to specific sensory signals ({$\eta$}2=0.04), and specific timepoints ({$\eta$}2=0.10), that were useful for them based on their caregivers' typical behavior. These findings provide a framework by which the predictability of caregiver behavior may shape fundamental, early optimization of visual attention for learning in infancy, and later cognitive development.},

The discussion of attrition and nonignorable missingness emphasizes the need for longitudinal diagnostics and for reducing the uncertainty about the missing data mechanism under attrition. Strategies suggested for reducing attrition bias include using auxiliary variables, collecting follow-up data on a sample of those initially missing, and collecting data on intent to drop out.

  abstract = {Conversation between two people involves subtle nonverbal coordination in addition to speech. However, the precise parameters and timing of this coordination remain unclear, which limits our ability to theorize about the neural and cognitive mechanisms of social coordination. In particular, it is unclear if conversation is dominated by synchronization (with no time lag), rapid and reactive mimicry (with lags under 1~s) or traditionally observed mimicry (with several seconds lag), each of which demands a different neural mechanism. Here we describe data from high-resolution motion capture of the head movements of pairs of participants (n\,=\,31 dyads) engaged in structured conversations. In a pre-registered analysis pathway, we calculated the wavelet coherence of head motion within dyads as a measure of their nonverbal coordination and report two novel results. First, low-frequency coherence (0.2--1.1~Hz) is consistent with traditional observations of mimicry, and modeling shows this behavior is generated by a mechanism with a constant 600~ms lag between leader and follower. This is in line with rapid reactive (rather than predictive or memory-driven) models of mimicry behavior, and could be implemented in mirror neuron systems. Second, we find an unexpected pattern of lower-than-chance coherence between participants, or hypo-coherence, at high frequencies (2.6--6.5~Hz). Exploratory analyses show that this systematic decoupling is driven by fast nodding from the listening member of the dyad, and may be a newly identified social signal. These results provide a step towards the quantification of real-world human behavior in high resolution and provide new insights into the mechanisms of social coordination.},

It is also shown how the way in which individuals may be in synchrony with one another can vary, and that these variations are related to their respective roles in the interaction. Some of the implications of the phenomenon of interactional synchrony are discussed.}

By integrating this tool within research practices, we aim to enhance data reproducibility and utility in social science research. Our approach draws on Design Science Research, proposing that MaskAnyone can facilitate safer data sharing and potentially reduce the storage of fully identifiable data. We discuss the development and capabilities of MaskAnyone, explore its integration into ethical research practices, and consider the broader implications of audio-visual data masking, including issues of consent and the risk of misuse. The paper concludes with a preliminary evaluation framework for assessing the effectiveness and ethical integration of masking tools in such research settings.},

  abstract = {In this increasingly data-rich world, visual recordings of human behavior are often unable to be shared due to concerns about privacy. Consequently, data sharing in fields such as behavioral science, multimodal communication, and human movement research is often limited. In addition, in legal and other non-scientific contexts, privacy-related concerns may preclude the sharing of video recordings and thus remove the rich multimodal context that humans recruit to communicate. Minimizing the risk of identity exposure while preserving critical behavioral information would maximize utility of public resources (e.g., research grants) and time invested in audio--visual\hspace{0pt} research. Here we present an open-source computer vision tool that masks the identities of humans while maintaining rich information about communicative body movements. Furthermore, this masking tool can be easily applied to many videos, leveraging computational tools to augment the reproducibility and accessibility of behavioral research. The tool is designed for researchers and practitioners engaged in kinematic and affective research. Application areas include teaching/education, communication and human movement research, CCTV, and legal contexts.},

Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is far less likely to predict false detections where nothing exists. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms all other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, by a wide margin when generalizing from natural images to artwork on both the Picasso Dataset and the People-Art Dataset.},

  abstract = {Measuring the quality of movement is a need and a challenge for clinicians. Jerk, defined as the quantity of acceleration variation, is a kinematic parameter used to assess the smoothness of movement. We aimed to assess and compare jerk metrics in asymptomatic participants for 3 important movement characteristics that are considered by clinicians during shoulder examination: dominant and non-dominant side, concentric and eccentric contraction mode, and arm elevation plane. In this pilot study, we measured jerk metrics by using Xsens{\textregistered} inertial measurement units strapped to the wrists for 11 different active arm movements (ascending and lowering phases): 3 bilateral maximal arm elevations in sagittal, scapular and frontal plane; 2 unilateral functional movements (hair combing and low back washing); and 2 unilateral maximal arm elevations in sagittal and scapular plane, performed with both arms alternately, right arm first. Each arm movement was repeated 3 times successively and the whole procedure was performed 3 times on different days. The recorded time series was segmented with semi-supervised algorithms. Comparisons involved the Wilcoxon signed rank test (p \&lt; 0.05) with Bonferroni correction. We included 30 right-handed asymptomatic individuals [17 men, mean (SD) age 31.9 (11.4) years]. Right jerk was significantly less than left jerk for bilateral arm elevations in all planes (all p \&lt; 0.05) and for functional movement (p \&lt; 0.05). Jerk was significantly reduced during the concentric (ascending) phase than eccentric (lowering) phase for bilateral and unilateral right and left arm elevations in all planes (all p \&lt; 0.05). Jerk during bilateral arm elevation was significantly reduced in the sagittal and scapular planes versus the frontal plane (both p \&lt; 0.01) and in the sagittal versus scapular plane (p \&lt; 0.05). Jerk during unilateral left arm elevation was significantly reduced in the sagittal versus scapular plane (p \&lt; 0.05). Jerk metrics did not differ between sagittal and scapular unilateral right arm elevation. Using inertial measurement units, jerk metrics can well describe differences between the dominant and non-dominant arm, concentric and eccentric modes and planes in arm elevation. Jerk metrics were reduced during arm movements performed with the dominant right arm during the concentric phase and in the sagittal plane. Using IMUs, jerk metrics are a promising method to assess the quality of basic shoulder movement.},

There is little agreement about what constitutes strong versus weak theory in the social sciences, but there is more consensus that references, data, variables, diagrams, and hypotheses are not theory. Despite this consensus, however, authors routinely use these five elements in lieu of theory. We explain how each of these five elements can be confused with theory and how to avoid such confusion. By making this consensus explicit, we hope to help authors avoid some of the most common and easily averted problems that lead readers to view papers as having inadequate theory. We then discuss how journals might facilitate the publication of stronger theory. We suggest that if the field is serious about producing stronger theory, journals need to reconsider their empirical requirements. We argue that journals ought to be more receptive to papers that test part rather than all of a theory and use illustrative rather than definitive data.},

  abstract = {Human synchronization refers to the coordination in time of individuals' actions, movements, or physiological processes, often considered within a rhythmical context. This phenomenon can occur in various forms such as matching rhythmic movements, aligning speech patterns, or synchronizing biological rhythms. It plays a crucial role in social interactions, effective communication, sports, and musical performance. This work aims to reference accessible online datasets related to human synchronization, to increase their visibility and availability. Notably, it compiles 75 directly accessible datasets and 26 with indirect access to study synchronization in various contexts. It reviews all types of synchronization tasks and contexts found in the datasets. Results are clustered into four categories: discontinuous movement, continuous movement, social interactions, and musical performance. Then, this review explores the signals and acquisition methods used across human synchronization datasets, ranging from simple touchpads, and kinematic sensors, to expansive motion capture and hyperscanning technologies. This paper surveys objective measures of synchronization used in the gathered papers and reveals some heterogeneity in the quantification of synchronization. Furthermore, it points out a lack of annotated datasets, which limits the development of machine learning methods. By compiling accessible datasets, this review centralizes valuable experimental data, providing a foundation for more collaborative, comprehensive, and standardized approaches to studying human synchronization.},
