  abstract = {Recent studies of dyadic interaction have examined phenomena of synchronization, entrainment, alignment, and convergence. All these forms of behavioral matching have been hypothesized to play a supportive role in establishing coordination and common ground between interlocutors. In the present study, evidence is found for a new kind of coordination termed complexity matching. Temporal dynamics in conversational speech signals were analyzed through time series of acoustic onset events. Timing in periods of acoustic energy was found to exhibit behavioral matching that reflects complementary timing in turn-taking. In addition, acoustic onset times were found to exhibit power law clustering across a range of timescales, and these power law functions were found to exhibit complexity matching that is distinct from behavioral matching. Complexity matching is discussed in terms of interactive alignment and other theoretical principles that lead to new hypotheses about information exchange in dyadic conversation and interaction in general.

Yet, the progression of medical LLMs faces obstacles such as complex training requirements, rigorous evaluation demands, and the dominance of proprietary models that restrict academic exploration. Transparent, comprehensive access to LLM resources is essential for advancing the field, fostering reproducibility, and encouraging innovation in healthcare AI. We present Hippocrates, an open-source LLM framework specifically developed for the medical domain. In stark contrast to previous efforts, it offers unrestricted access to its training datasets, codebase, checkpoints, and evaluation protocols. This open approach is designed to stimulate collaborative research, allowing the community to build upon, refine, and rigorously evaluate medical LLMs within a transparent ecosystem. Also, we introduce Hippo, a family of 7B models tailored for the medical domain, fine-tuned from Mistral and LLaMA2 through continual pre-training, instruction tuning, and reinforcement learning from human and AI feedback. Our models outperform existing open medical LLMs models by a large-margin, even surpassing models with 70B parameters. Through Hippocrates, we aspire to unlock the full potential of LLMs not just to advance medical knowledge and patient care but also to democratize the benefits of AI research in healthcare, making them available across the globe.},

  abstract = {Language is intrinsically multimodal. Speakers use gestures, prosody, gaze, and facial expressions as cues that complement and expand the meaning expressed in their words. These varied signals operate in remarkably flexible coordination, constantly adapting to the conversational partners and topics as they change over time. We argue that an ecological approach to multimodal behavior offers a promising account of natural conversation as it takes place both in experimental contexts, and in natural ones outside the lab. After reviewing major historical themes in the study of language and communication, we describe how this ecological perspective situates future work, especially work that seeks to quantify these processes. We describe a quantitative hypothesis that multimodal signals are projected on manifolds of lower dimension that can be described in terms of dynamical systems. We refer to these lower dimensional patterns as ``pragmatic modes,'' and compare this idea to a number of prior theoretical proposals. We describe how the notion of pragmatic mode frames a quantitative basis to supplement and extend prior research with explicitly quantitative goals. The paper concludes with an outline to link quantitative descriptions of multimodality with more abstract, qualitative theories of the past few decades, and describe how future research might explore pragmatic modes, how they change over the course of conversation, and relate to our understanding of human communication.},

This work combines a YOLOv8-based human pose estimation approach with 3D Mean Shift clustering for the detection and analysis of behavioral characteristics in social groups, using 3D point clouds generated by the Intel\textregistered{} RealSense™D435i as a cost-effective alternative to LiDAR systems. Our proposed method achieves 97\% accuracy in classifying social group geometric configurations (L, C, and I patterns) and demonstrates the value of depth information by reaching 50\% precision in 3D group detection using adaptive clustering, significantly outperforming standard 2D approaches. Validation was conducted with 12 participants across 8 experimental scenarios, demonstrating robust estimation of body orientation (40{$^\circ$} error), a key indicator for interaction analysis, while head direction estimation presented greater variability (70{$^\circ$} error), both measured relative to the depth plane and compared against OptiTrack ground truth data. The framework processes 120 samples at 2--6m distances, achieving 70\% torso orientation accuracy at 5m and identifying triadic L-shaped groups with F1-score=0.91. These results enable autonomous robots to quantify group centroids, analyze interaction patterns, and navigate dynamically using real-time convex hull approximations. The integration of accessible 3D perception with efficient processing could enhance human-robot interactions, demonstrating its feasibility in applications such as social robotics, healthcare, care environments, and service industries, where social adaptability and collaborative decision-making are essential.},

  abstract = {Personalized medicine aims to tailor medical treatments to the unique characteristics of each patient, but its effectiveness relies on achieving diagnostic accuracy to fully understand individual variability in disease response and treatment efficacy. This systematic literature review explores the role of large language models (LLMs) in enhancing diagnostic precision and supporting the advancement of personalized medicine. A comprehensive search was conducted across Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore, targeting peer-reviewed articles published in English between January 2020 and March 2025 that applied LLMs within personalized medicine contexts. Following PRISMA guidelines, 39 relevant studies were selected and systematically analyzed. The findings indicate a growing integration of LLMs across key domains such as clinical informatics, medical imaging, patient-specific diagnosis, and clinical decision support. LLMs have shown potential in uncovering subtle data patterns critical for accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment planning. This review highlights the expanding role of LLMs in improving diagnostic accuracy in personalized medicine, offering insights into their performance, applications, and challenges, while also acknowledging limitations in generalizability due to variable model performance and dataset biases. The review highlights the importance of addressing challenges related to data privacy, model interpretability, and reliability across diverse clinical scenarios. For successful clinical integration, future research must focus on refining LLM technologies, ensuring ethical standards, and validating models continuously to safeguard effective and responsible use in healthcare environments.},

Almost anyone who is interested can observe and describe such phenomena. But usually scientists demand more. They want observations that are replicable and amenable to scientific analysis, while still faithful to the dynamics of the phenomena studied. This book provides a straightforward introduction to scientific methods for observing social behavior. Because of the importance of time in the dynamics of social interaction, sequential approaches to analyzing and understanding social behavior are emphasized. An advanced knowledge of statistical analysis is not required. Instead, the authors present fundamental concepts and offer practical advice.},

  abstract = {Quantitative measures of smoothness play an important role in the assessment of sensorimotor impairment and motor learning. Traditionally, movement smoothness has been computed mainly for discrete movements, in particular arm, reaching and circle drawing, using kinematic data. There are currently very few studies investigating smoothness of rhythmic movements, and there is no systematic way of analysing the smoothness of such movements. There is also very little work on the smoothness of other movement related variables such as force, impedance etc. In this context, this paper presents the first step towards a unified framework for the analysis of smoothness of arbitrary movements and using various data. It starts with a systematic definition of movement smoothness and the different factors that influence smoothness, followed by a review of existing methods for quantifying the smoothness of discrete movements. A method is then introduced to analyse the smoothness of rhythmic movements by generalising the techniques developed for discrete movements. We finally propose recommendations for analysing smoothness of any general sensorimotor behaviour.},

  abstract = {Principles of a dynamic, dyadic systems view of mother-infant face-to-face communication, which considers self- and interactive processes in relation to one another, were tested. The process of interaction across time in a large low-risk community sample at infant age 4 months was examined. Split-screen videotape was coded on a 1-s time base for communication modalities of attention, affect, orientation, touch, and composite facial-visual engagement. Time-series approaches generated self- and interactive contingency estimates in each modality. Evidence supporting the following principles was obtained: (a) Significant moment-to-moment predictability within each partner (self-contingency) and between the partners (interactive contingency) characterizes mother-infant communication. (b) Interactive contingency is organized by a bidirectional, but asymmetrical, process: Maternal contingent coordination with infant is higher than infant contingent coordination with mother. (c) Self-contingency organizes communication to a far greater extent than interactive contingency. (d) Self- and interactive contingency processes are not separate; each affects the other in communication modalities of facial affect, facial-visual engagement, and orientation. Each person's self-organization exists in a dynamic, homoeostatic (negative feedback) balance with the degree to which the person coordinates with the partner. For example, those individuals who are less facially stable are likely to coordinate more strongly with the partner's facial affect and vice versa. Our findings support the concept that the dyad is a fundamental unit of analysis in the investigation of early interaction. Moreover, an individual's self-contingency is influenced by the way the individual coordinates with the partner. Our results imply that it is not appropriate to conceptualize interactive processes without simultaneously accounting for dynamically interrelated self-organizing processes.},

On its own, the mere mathematical idea of a dynamical system is too weak to serve as a scientific theory of anything, and dynamical approaches within cognitive science are too rich and varied to be subsumed under a single ``dynamical hypothesis.'' Instead, after first attempting to dissect the different notions of ``dynamics'' and ``cognition'' at play, a more specific theoretical framework for cognitive science broadly construed is sketched. This framework draws upon not only dynamical ideas, but also such contemporaneous perspectives as situatedness, embodiment, ecological psychology, enaction, neuroethology/neuroscience, artificial life, and biogenic approaches. The paper ends with some methodological suggestions for pursuing this theoretical framework.},

Clues to endocrine and physiologic abnormalities may also become apparent---the rounded facies of Cushing's disease, the prominent jaw and frontal bossing of acromegaly, or the exophthalmos of hyperthyroidism. Icteric sclera may tell more about a patient's alcohol problem than can be stated. Pallor may quickly explain shortness of breath. Lateral thinning of the eyebrows may suggest hypothyroidism; periorbital edema may represent the nephrotic syndrome; and a butterfly rash may predict lupus erythematosus. A simple handshake may help assess the circulatory system, suggest active inflammation in the patient with arthritis, or differentiate the cold and moist hands of the anxious patient from the warm and moist ones of the thyrotoxic patient. The patient's voice may suggest fear, depression, or mania. Speech can also be the first clue to dysarthria or aphasia. The thickened, low pitch of hypothyroidism or hoarseness of laryngeal carcinoma can be detected by a careful listener. Observation of a shuffling gait will require a particular review of symptoms for signs of Parkinsons's disease and a physical examination particularly directed toward the assessment of mobility. Similarly, gait may suggest a mild hemiparesis secondary to stroke, or the ataxia of cerebellar disease.},

A number of effective methods relying on data-driven, model-based and statistical approaches have emerged in the past two decades. They exhibit increasing ability to estimate the blood volume pulse (BVP) signal upon which BPMs (Beats per Minute) can be estimated. Furthermore, learning-based rPPG methods have been recently proposed. The present pyVHR framework represents a multi-stage pipeline covering the whole process for extracting and analyzing HR fluctuations. It is designed for both theoretical studies and practical applications in contexts where wearable sensors are inconvenient to use. Namely, pyVHR supports either the development, assessment and statistical analysis of novel rPPG methods, either traditional or learning-based, or simply the sound comparison of well-established methods on multiple datasets. It is built up on accelerated Python libraries for video and signal processing as well as equipped with parallel/accelerated ad-hoc procedures paving the way to online processing on a GPU. The whole accelerated process can be safely run in real-time for 30 fps HD videos with an average speedup of around 5. This paper is shaped in the form of a gentle tutorial presentation of the framework.},

  abstract = {The scale of human cooperation is an evolutionary puzzle. All of the available evidence suggests that the societies of our Pliocene ancestors were like those of other social primates, and this means that human psychology has changed in ways that support larger, more cooperative societies that characterize modern humans. In this paper, we argue that cultural adaptation is a key factor in these changes. Over the last million years or so, people evolved the ability to learn from each other, creating the possibility of cumulative, cultural evolution. Rapid cultural adaptation also leads to persistent differences between local social groups, and then competition between groups leads to the spread of behaviours that enhance their competitive ability. Then, in such culturally evolved cooperative social environments, natural selection within groups favoured genes that gave rise to new, more pro-social motives. Moral systems enforced by systems of sanctions and rewards increased the reproductive success of individuals who functioned well in such environments, and this in turn led to the evolution of other regarding motives like empathy and social emotions like shame.},

No universally correct methods exist; methods only fit the purpose for which they have been designed or chosen. Therefore, choosing appropriate methods is critical. The starting points are always the research question and the construct(s) the research question addresses, which impacts all further decisions. This chapter presents decisions researchers will face before starting the actual coding process. Then, it introduces a system that can help identify appropriate coding schemes. In the following section, the chapter discusses potential conflicts during the actual process of coding interaction. Then it presents some general instructions about how interaction coding data can be aggregated for further analyses after coding. The chapter concludes with a short discussion of why interaction coding is not a trivial undertaking and the future methodological developments.

Research performed for the purpose of demonstration is conducted to establish empirically the existence of a phenomenon or relationship. The tripartite distinction between internal, external, and construct validity, provides the basis for organizing the discussion of validity issues. Construct validity refers to inferences made at both stages of research linking concepts to operations. The chapter uses the concept of demand characteristics to illustrate the difference between methodological confounds (which affect construct validity) and methodological artifacts. Construct validity represents one form of generalizing from the observed results of an empirical study to conclusions that go beyond the results themselves. The debate includes discussions of whether there are necessary trade-offs among the various aspects of validity or whether it is possible to demand that research maximize internal, external, and construct validity simultaneously.},

In this work, we present a realtime approach to detect the 2D pose of multiple people in an image. The proposed method uses a nonparametric representation, which we refer to as Part Affinity Fields (PAFs), to learn to associate body parts with individuals in the image. This bottom-up system achieves high accuracy and realtime performance, regardless of the number of people in the image. In previous work, PAFs and body part location estimation were refined simultaneously across training stages. We demonstrate that a PAF-only refinement rather than both PAF and body part location refinement results in a substantial increase in both runtime performance and accuracy. We also present the first combined body and foot keypoint detector, based on an internal annotated foot dataset that we have publicly released. We show that the combined detector not only reduces the inference time compared to running them sequentially, but also maintains the accuracy of each component individually. This work has culminated in the release of OpenPose, the first open-source realtime system for multi-person 2D pose detection, including body, foot, hand, and facial keypoints.},

This paper explores the transformation of psychological testing and assessment in the context of digital footprints and the rise of machine learning (ML) tools. The emergence of smartphones, wearables, and social media platforms has allowed for the collection of passive data, significantly impacting how psychological states are evaluated. This shift offers enhanced insights into personality traits and psychological symptoms, while reducing reliance on traditional self-report methods. However, the use of machine learning to interpret large volumes of behavioral data raises concerns about ethical implications, particularly regarding privacy, consent, and algorithmic transparency. Furthermore, methodological challenges, such as the reliability and validity of AI-based assessments, complicate the integration of these tools into mainstream psychological practice. This paper aims to critically evaluate the benefits and limitations of digital footprints and ML in psychological assessment, emphasizing the need for ethical frameworks and robust methodologies to ensure their effective and safe implementation.

We argue that progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers timely opportunities for cognitive science to embrace experiments with increasingly naturalistic stimuli, tasks, and behaviors; and computational models that can accommodate these changes. We first review a growing body of research spanning neuroscience, cognitive science, and AI that suggests that incorporating a broader range of naturalistic experimental paradigms, and models that accommodate them, may be necessary to resolve some aspects of natural intelligence and ensure that our theories generalize. First, we review cases from cognitive science and neuroscience where naturalistic paradigms elicit distinct behaviors or engage different processes. We then discuss recent progress in AI that shows that learning from naturalistic data yields qualitatively different patterns of behavior and generalization, and discuss how these findings impact the conclusions we draw from cognitive modeling, and can help yield new hypotheses for the roots of cognitive and neural phenomena. We then suggest that integrating recent progress in AI and cognitive science will enable us to engage with more naturalistic phenomena without giving up experimental control or the pursuit of theoretically grounded understanding. We offer practical guidance on how methodological practices can contribute to cumulative progress in naturalistic computational cognitive science, and illustrate a path towards building computational models that solve the real problems of natural cognition, together with a reductive understanding of the processes and principles by which they do so.},

With the unprecedented scale of training and model parameters, the capability of large language models has been dramatically improved, leading to human-like performances in understanding, language synthesizing, common-sense reasoning, etc. Such a major leap forward in general AI capacity will fundamentally change the pattern of how personalization is conducted. For one thing, it will reform the way of interaction between humans and personalization systems. Instead of being a passive medium of information filtering, like conventional recommender systems and search engines, large language models present the foundation for active user engagement. On top of such a new foundation, users' requests can be proactively explored, and users' required information can be delivered in a natural, interactable, and explainable way. For another thing, it will also considerably expand the scope of personalization, making it grow from the sole function of collecting personalized information to the compound function of providing personalized services. By leveraging large language models as a general-purpose interface, the personalization systems may compile user's requests into plans, calls the functions of external tools (e.g., search engines, calculators, service APIs, etc.) to execute the plans, and integrate the tools' outputs to complete the end-to-end personalization tasks. Today, large language models are still being rapidly developed, whereas the application in personalization is largely unexplored. Therefore, we consider it to be right the time to review the challenges in personalization and the opportunities to address them with large language models. In particular, we dedicate this perspective paper to the discussion of the following aspects: the development and challenges for the existing personalization system, the newly emerged capabilities of large language models, and the potential ways of making use of large language models for personalization.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the R package crqa to perform cross-recurrence quantification analysis of two time series of either a categorical or continuous nature. Streams of behavioral information, from eye movements to linguistic elements, unfold over time. When two people interact, such as in conversation, they often adapt to each other, leading these behavioral levels to exhibit recurrent states. In dialog, for example, interlocutors adapt to each other by exchanging interactive cues: smiles, nods, gestures, choice of words, and so on. In order for us to capture closely the goings-on of dynamic interaction, and uncover the extent of coupling between two individuals, we need to quantify how much recurrence is taking place at these levels. Methods available in crqa would allow researchers in cognitive science to pose such questions as how much are two people recurrent at some level of analysis, what is the characteristic lag time for one person to maximally match another, or whether one person is leading another. First, we set the theoretical ground to understand the difference between ``correlation'' and ``co-visitation'' when comparing two time series, using an aggregative or cross-recurrence approach. Then, we describe more formally the principles of cross-recurrence, and show with the current package how to carry out analyses applying them. We end the paper by comparing computational efficiency, and results' consistency, of crqa R package, with the benchmark MATLAB toolbox crptoolbox (Marwan, 2013). We show perfect comparability between the two libraries on both levels.},

  abstract = {In health, most large language model (LLM) research has focused on clinical tasks. However, mobile and wearable devices, which are rarely integrated into such tasks, provide rich, longitudinal data for personal health monitoring. Here we present Personal Health Large Language Model (PH-LLM), fine-tuned from Gemini for understanding and reasoning over numerical time-series personal health data. We created and curated three datasets that test 1) production of personalized insights and recommendations from sleep patterns, physical activity, and physiological responses, 2) expert domain knowledge, and 3) prediction of self-reported sleep outcomes. For the first task we designed 857 case studies in collaboration with domain experts to assess real-world scenarios in sleep and fitness. Through comprehensive evaluation of domain-specific rubrics, we observed that Gemini Ultra 1.0 and PH-LLM are not statistically different from expert performance in fitness and, while experts remain superior for sleep, fine-tuning PH-LLM provided significant improvements in using relevant domain knowledge and personalizing information for sleep insights. We evaluated PH-LLM domain knowledge using multiple choice sleep medicine and fitness examinations. PH-LLM achieved 79\% on sleep and 88\% on fitness, exceeding average scores from a sample of human experts. Finally, we trained PH-LLM to predict self-reported sleep quality outcomes from textual and multimodal encoding representations of wearable data, and demonstrate that multimodal encoding is required to match performance of specialized discriminative models. Although further development and evaluation are necessary in the safety-critical personal health domain, these results demonstrate both the broad knowledge and capabilities of Gemini models and the benefit of contextualizing physiological data for personal health applications as done with PH-LLM.},

  abstract = {The availability of smart devices has made it possible to collect intensive longitudinal data (ILD) from individuals, providing a unique opportunity to study the complex dynamics of psychological systems. Existing time-series methods often have limitations, such as assuming linear interactions or having restricted forms, leading to difficulties in capturing the complex nature of these systems. To address this issue, we introduce fitlandr, a method with implementation as an R package that integrates nonparametric estimation of the drift-diffusion function and stability landscape. The drift-diffusion function is estimated using the multivariate kernel estimator (MVKE; Bandi \& Moloche, 2018), and the stability landscape is estimated through Monte-Carlo estimation of the steady-state distribution (Cui et al., 2021; Cui, Lichtwarck-Aschoff, et al., 2023). Using a simulated emotional system, we demonstrate that fitlandr can effectively recover bistable dynamics from data, even in the presence of moderate noise, and that it primarily relies on dynamic information from the system instead of distributional information. We then apply the method to two empirical single-participant experience sampling method data sets and compared the results with the simulation data sets. Whereas both data sets show a bimodal distribution, fitlandr only revealed bistability in one of them, indicating that bimodality in ILD does not necessarily imply the existence of bistability in the underlying system. These results demonstrate the potential of fitlandr as a tool for uncovering the rich, nonlinear dynamics of psychological systems from ILD.

At the same time, the field of psychology is grappling with how to improve research practices to address concerns with the scientific enterprise. In this Perspective, we argue that both of these challenges can be addressed by adopting a principle of methodological variety. According to this principle, developing a variety of methodological tools should be regarded as a scientific goal in itself, one that is critical for advancing scientific theory. To illustrate, we show how the study of language and communication requires varied methodologies, and that theory development proceeds, in part, by integrating disparate tools and designs. We argue that the importance of methodological variation and innovation runs deep, travelling alongside theory development to the core of the scientific enterprise. Finally, we highlight ongoing research agendas that might help to specify, quantify and model methodological variety and its implications.},

However, our understanding of processes and mechanisms by which maternal behavior influences the developing human brain remains limited. Animal research has illustrated that patterns of sensory information is important in shaping neural circuits during development. Here we examined the relation between degree of predictability of maternal sensory signals early in life and subsequent cognitive function in both humans (n = 128 mother/infant dyads) and rats (n = 12 dams; 28 adolescents). Behaviors of mothers interacting with their offspring were observed in both species, and an entropy rate was calculated as a quantitative measure of degree of predictability of transitions among maternal sensory signals (visual, auditory, and tactile). Human cognitive function was assessed at age 2 y with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and at age 6.5 y with a hippocampus-dependent delayed-recall task. Rat hippocampus-dependent spatial memory was evaluated on postnatal days 49--60. Early life exposure to unpredictable sensory signals portended poor cognitive performance in both species. The present study provides evidence that predictability of maternal sensory signals early in life impacts cognitive function in both rats and humans. The parallel between experimental animal and observational human data lends support to the argument that predictability of maternal sensory signals causally influences cognitive development.},

We build on findings that in a number of Indigenous American communities, fluid and harmonious collaboration is prioritized both in community organization at a scale of years and centuries, and in everyday family interactions and researcher-\- organized tasks at a scale of days, hours, or minutes. We examined whether this sophisticated fluid collaboration could be seen even at a scale of fractions of seconds. At a microscale of 200-\-millisecond segments, Guatemalan Mayan triads of mothers and children frequently engaged mutually, in fluid synchrony together, when exploring novel objects. They did so more commonly than did European American mother-\-child triads, who usually engaged solo or in dyads, with one person left out, or resisted each other. This microanalysis of mutuality in family interactions reveals the role of culture in the foundations of thinking and working together in both Mayan and European American communities, and the fruitfulness of considering developmental processes holistically.},

As these systems are increasingly being deployed in high-stakes real-world applications, there is a dire need to ensure that they do not propagate or amplify any discriminatory tendencies in historical or human-curated data or inadvertently learn biases from spurious correlations. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on fairness that summarizes and sheds light on ongoing trends and successes in the context of computer vision. The topics we discuss include 1) The origin and technical definitions of fairness drawn from the wider fair machine learning literature and adjacent disciplines. 2) Work that sought to discover and analyze biases in computer vision systems. 3) A summary of methods proposed to mitigate bias in computer vision systems in recent years. 4) A comprehensive summary of resources and datasets produced by researchers to measure, analyze, and mitigate bias and enhance fairness. 5) Discussion of the field's success, continuing trends in the context of multimodal foundation and generative models, and gaps that still need to be addressed. The presented characterization should help researchers understand the importance of identifying and mitigating bias in computer vision and the state of the field and identify potential directions for future research.},

We then see that both~knowing and loving are existential, dialectic ways in which concrete and particular beings engage with each other.},

  abstract = {Since the 1970s, social psychology has examined real human behaviour to an increasingly smaller degree. This article is an analysis of the reasons why this is so. The author points out that the otherwise valuable phenomenon of cognitive shift, which occurred in social psychology precisely in the 1970s, naturally boosted the interest of psychologists in such phenomena like stereotypes, attitudes, and values; at the same time, it unfortunately decreased interest in others, like aggression, altruism, and social influence. In recent decades, we have also witnessed a growing conviction among psychologists that explaining why people display certain reactions holds greater importance than demonstrating the conditions under which people display these reactions. This assumption has been accompanied by the spread of statistical analysis applied to empirical data, which has led to researchers today generally preferring to employ survey studies (even if they are a component of experiments being conducted) to the analysis of behavioural variables. The author analyses the contents of the most recent volume of ``Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', and argues that it is essentially devoid of presentations of empirical studies in which human behaviours are examined. This gives rise to the question of whether social psychology remains a science of behaviour, and whether such a condition of the discipline is desirable.},

To this end, the limitations of current statistical paradigms in mental health research are critiqued, and an introduction is provided to critical machine learning methods used in clinical studies. A selective literature review is then presented aiming to reinforce the usefulness of machine learning methods and provide evidence of their potential.

This article outlines methodological considerations and the decision-making process for measurement selection for child behavior, parenting/caregiver-child interactions, and the family/home environment for HBCD. The decision-making process is detailed, including formation of a national workgroup (WG-BEH) that focused on developmentally appropriate measures that take a rigorous and equitable approach and aligned with HBCD objectives. Multi-level-observational and caregiver-report measures were deemed necessary for capturing the desired constructs across multiple contexts while balancing the nuance of observational data with pragmatic considerations. WG-BEH prioritized developmentally sensitive, validated assessments with psychometrics supporting use in diverse populations and focused on mechanistic linkages and prediction of desired constructs. Other considerations included participant burden and retention, staff training needs, and cultural sensitivity. Innovation was permitted when it was grounded in evidence and filled key gaps. Finally, this article describes the rationale for the selected constructs (e.g., temperament, social-emotional development, parenting behaviors, family organization) and corresponding measures chosen for HBCD visits from early infancy through 17 months of age.},

Here, we address this question with respect to joint activity and social behavior via an explication of Guy Van Orden's formulation of interaction-dominant dynamics and his provocative discussion of the ``blue collar brain.'' Using these 2 concepts we argue that human social behavior and performance is not controlled by a cascade of fast timescale activity (i.e., neural processes or individual action) but rather emerges from the modulated enslavement of faster timescale processes by much slower dynamical processes, such as shared task outcomes and socially defined historical context. We detail this argument by reviewing 2 recent behavioral findings that we believe provide evidence that the dynamics of human performance during a socially situated activity is interaction dominant. The first concerns the behavioral coordination that emerges during a novel joint-action collision-avoidance task. The second concerns the effects of stereotype threat on an individual's cognitive performance. Finally, we discuss how identifying the role that the slower timescale dynamics of social events and structures plays in shaping complex behavioral dynamics can guide future research on joint-action and human performance.},

Nonetheless, it may result in significant discrimination if not handled properly as CV systems highly depend on the data they are fed with and can learn and amplify biases within such data. Thus, the problems of understanding and discovering biases are of utmost importance. Yet, there is no comprehensive survey on bias in visual datasets. Hence, this work aims to: i) describe the biases that might manifest in visual datasets; ii) review the literature on methods for bias discovery and quantification in visual datasets; iii) discuss existing attempts to collect bias-aware visual datasets. A key conclusion of our study is that the problem of bias discovery and quantification in visual datasets is still open, and there is room for improvement in terms of both methods and the range of biases that can be addressed. Moreover, there is no such thing as a bias-free dataset, so scientists and practitioners must become aware of the biases in their datasets and make them explicit. To this end, we propose a checklist to spot different types of bias during visual dataset collection.},

The systems approach further assumes that the control parameter responsible for eliciting developmental change may be different depending on age, context, and task. It offers a means to understand previously unexplained developmental phenomena: the appearance of mature forms of expression before mature functon has been achieved, the asynchronous rates of development of communicative-action components, discontinuous developmental shifts arising from continuous processes, and the process by which adults influence communicative development.

  abstract = {In recent years, human pose estimation has been widely studied as a branch task of computer vision. Human pose estimation plays an important role in the development of medicine, fitness, virtual reality, and other fields. Early human pose estimation technology used traditional manual modeling methods. Recently, human pose estimation technology has developed rapidly using deep learning. This study not only reviews the basic research of human pose estimation but also summarizes the latest cutting-edge technologies. In addition to systematically summarizing the human pose estimation technology, this article also extends to the upstream and downstream tasks of human pose estimation, which shows the positioning of human pose estimation technology more intuitively. In particular, considering the issues regarding computer resources and challenges concerning model performance faced by human pose estimation, the lightweight human pose estimation models and the transformer-based human pose estimation models are summarized in this paper. In general, this article classifies human pose estimation technology around types of methods, 2D or 3D representation of outputs, the number of people, views, and temporal information. Meanwhile, classic datasets and targeted datasets are mentioned in this paper, as well as metrics applied to these datasets. Finally, we generalize the current challenges and possible development of human pose estimation technology in the future.},

This study presents a vision-based, marker-less measurement system for real-time 3D human pose estimation. The system exploits pre-trained 2D human pose detection models and integrates an \textbackslash alpha \textbackslash text -\textbackslash beta \textbackslash text -\textbackslash gamma filter to reduce fluctuations in detected key points. It also introduces a novel Weighted Direct Linear Triangulation method, enhancing 3D reconstruction accuracy by assigning higher weights to key points consistent across current and previous frames. The method's accuracy and execution time are assessed using the public Human3.6M dataset, evaluating different model configurations, formats, camera setups, and acquisition modes for real-time applications. The YOLOv8x-pose model with four cameras achieves the highest accuracy, with a Mean-Per-Joint Position Error of 18.2 mm and an execution time of 15 ms, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Converting models to the TensorRT framework reduces execution time by 4.2 ms without significant accuracy loss. The system is integrated into a clinical rehabilitation device, a three-degree-of-freedom parallel kinematic machine, to facilitate patient participation in exergames. The proposed human-pose estimation method achieves real-time performance, enabling the motion platform to be controlled dynamically based on the patient's actual standing pose.},

Contrary to the predictions of homeostasis, however, the output of a wide variety of systems, such as the normal human heartbeat, fluctuates in a complex manner, even under resting conditions. Scaling techniques adapted from statistical physics reveal the presence of long-range, power-law correlations, as part of multifractal cascades operating over a wide range of time scales. These scaling properties suggest that the nonlinear regulatory systems are operating far from equilibrium, and that maintaining constancy is not the goal of physiologic control. In contrast, for subjects at high risk of sudden death (including those with heart failure), fractal organization, along with certain nonlinear interactions, breaks down. Application of fractal analysis may provide new approaches to assessing cardiac risk and forecasting sudden cardiac death, as well as to monitoring the aging process. Similar approaches show promise in assessing other regulatory systems, such as human gait control in health and disease. Elucidating the fractal and nonlinear mechanisms involved in physiologic control and complex signaling networks is emerging as a major challenge in the postgenomic era.},

Traitlike individual differences and relationship variables then sensitize individuals to these contextual ``pulls.'' In this manner, context, individual differences, and relationship variables provide the backdrop to the emergence of flexible and dynamical synchrony patterns, which we consider adaptive, in several modalities---behavioral, physiological, and neural. We point to three consequences of synchrony patterns: social-, task, and self-oriented. We discuss multimodal associations that arise in different contexts considering the theory and delineate hypotheses that emanate from the theory. We then provide two empirical proofs-of-concept: First, we show how individual differences modulate the effect of context on synchrony's outcomes in a novel dyadic motor game. Second, we reanalyze previously reported data, to show how a ``flexibility'' approach to synchrony data analysis improves predictive ability when testing for synchrony's effects on social cohesion.

Solutions are given for missing data challenges such as handling longitudinal, categorical, and clustered data with normal-model MI; including interactions in the missing data model; and handling large numbers of variables. The discussion of attrition and nonignorable missingness emphasizes the need for longitudinal diagnostics and for reducing the uncertainty about the missing data mechanism under attrition. Strategies suggested for reducing attrition bias include using auxiliary variables, collecting follow-up data on a sample of those initially missing, and collecting data on intent to drop out. Suggestions are given for moving forward with research on missing data and attrition.},

  abstract = {Multimodal communication research focuses on how different means of signalling coordinate to communicate effectively. This line of research is traditionally influenced by fields such as cognitive and neuroscience, human-computer interaction, and linguistics. With new technologies becoming available in fields such as natural language processing and computer vision, the field can increasingly avail itself of new ways of analyzing and understanding multimodal communication. As a result, there is a general hope that multimodal research may be at the ``precipice of greatness'' due to technological advances in computer science and resulting extended empirical coverage. However, for this to come about there must be sufficient guidance on key (theoretical) needs of innovation in the field of multimodal communication. Absent such guidance, the research focus of computer scientists might increasingly diverge from crucial issues in multimodal communication. With this paper, we want to further promote interaction between these fields, which may enormously benefit both communities. The multimodal research community (represented here by a consortium of researchers from the Visual Communication [ViCom] Priority Programme) can engage in the innovation by clearly stating which technological tools are needed to make progress in the field of multimodal communication. In this article, we try to facilitate the establishment of a much needed common ground on feasible expectations (e.g., in terms of terminology and measures to be able to train machine learning algorithms) and to critically reflect possibly idle hopes for technical advances, informed by recent successes and challenges in computer science, social signal processing, and related domains.},

  abstract = {Video game competitions known as ``esports'' are rapidly gaining popularity around the world. Esports is legally recognized as a sport in several countries. It was a demonstration event at the 2018 Asian Games and was discussed as a potential addition to the Olympic program at the 2018 Esports Forum, organized by the International Olympic Committee. Even so, the status of esports remains a highly disputed topic in academia. In this paper, we argue that to be promoted as a full-fledged sport esports has to be associated with talents and health benefits similar to traditional sports. Existing studies indicate that traditional team sports and amateur gaming are both related to cognitive advantages. To evaluate the extent of this similarity at the professional level, we assessed perceptual-cognitive abilities of (semi-)professional esports players (N\,=\,31) and professional soccer and basketball players (N\,=\,43). Esports players and athletes performed equally well in complex tests measuring attentional control, short-term and working spatial memory span, attention distribution, reaction time, and hand-eye coordination. Esports players outperformed athletes in the speed of visual search. This data supports the idea that esports and traditional team sports demand a similar level of perceptual-cognitive ability from professionals and might provide similar cognitive benefits.},

  abstract = {This 1983 book is a lively and clearly written introduction to the philosophy of natural science, organized around the central theme of scientific realism. It has two parts. 'Representing' deals with the different philosophical accounts of scientific objectivity and the reality of scientific entities. The views of Kuhn, Feyerabend, Lakatos, Putnam, van Fraassen, and others, are all considered. 'Intervening' presents the first sustained treatment of experimental science for many years and uses it to give a new direction to debates about realism. Hacking illustrates how experimentation often has a life independent of theory. He argues that although the philosophical problems of scientific realism can not be resolved when put in terms of theory alone, a sound philosophy of experiment provides compelling grounds for a realistic attitude. A great many scientific examples are described in both parts of the book, which also includes lucid expositions of recent high energy physics and a remarkable chapter on the microscope in cell biology.},

  abstract = {Conversation between two people involves subtle nonverbal coordination in addition to speech. However, the precise parameters and timing of this coordination remain unclear, which limits our ability to theorize about the neural and cognitive mechanisms of social coordination. In particular, it is unclear if conversation is dominated by synchronization (with no time lag), rapid and reactive mimicry (with lags under 1 s) or traditionally observed mimicry (with several seconds lag), each of which demands a different neural mechanism. Here we describe data from high-resolution motion capture of the head movements of pairs of participants (n\,=\,31 dyads) engaged in structured conversations. In a pre-registered analysis pathway, we calculated the wavelet coherence of head motion within dyads as a measure of their nonverbal coordination and report two novel results. First, low-frequency coherence (0.2--1.1 Hz) is consistent with traditional observations of mimicry, and modeling shows this behavior is generated by a mechanism with a constant 600 ms lag between leader and follower. This is in line with rapid reactive (rather than predictive or memory-driven) models of mimicry behavior, and could be implemented in mirror neuron systems. Second, we find an unexpected pattern of lower-than-chance coherence between participants, or hypo-coherence, at high frequencies (2.6--6.5 Hz). Exploratory analyses show that this systematic decoupling is driven by fast nodding from the listening member of the dyad, and may be a newly identified social signal. These results provide a step towards the quantification of real-world human behavior in high resolution and provide new insights into the mechanisms of social coordination.},

  abstract = {How our collective intelligence has helped us to evolve and prosper Humans are a puzzling species. On the one hand, we struggle to survive on our own in the wild, often failing to overcome even basic challenges, like obtaining food, building shelters, or avoiding predators. On the other hand, human groups have produced ingenious technologies, sophisticated languages, and complex institutions that have permitted us to successfully expand into a vast range of diverse environments. What has enabled us to dominate the globe, more than any other species, while remaining virtually helpless as lone individuals? This book shows that the secret of our success lies not in our innate intelligence, but in our collective brains---on the ability of human groups to socially interconnect and learn from one another over generations. Drawing insights from lost European explorers, clever chimpanzees, mobile hunter-gatherers, neuroscientific findings, ancient bones, and the human genome, Joseph Henrich demonstrates how our collective brains have propelled our species' genetic evolution and shaped our biology. Our early capacities for learning from others produced many cultural innovations, such as fire, cooking, water containers, plant knowledge, and projectile weapons, which in turn drove the expansion of our brains and altered our physiology, anatomy, and psychology in crucial ways. Later on, some collective brains generated and recombined powerful concepts, such as the lever, wheel, screw, and writing, while also creating the institutions that continue to alter our motivations and perceptions. Henrich shows how our genetics and biology are inextricably interwoven with cultural evolution, and how culture-gene interactions launched our species on an extraordinary evolutionary trajectory. Tracking clues from our ancient past to the present, The Secret of Our Success explores how the evolution of both our cultural and social natures produce a collective intelligence that explains both our species' immense success and the origins of human uniqueness.},

  abstract = {Behavioral scientists routinely publish broad claims about human psychology and behavior in the world's top journals based on samples drawn entirely from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. Researchers---often implicitly---assume that either there is little variation across human populations, or that these ``standard subjects'' are as representative of the species as any other population. Are these assumptions justified? Here, our review of the comparative database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations and that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species---frequent outliers. The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral reasoning, reasoning styles, selfconcepts and related motivations, and the heritability of IQ. The findings suggest that members of WEIRD societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans. Many of these findings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior---hence, there are no obvious a priori grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing questions of human nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity. We close by proposing ways to structurally re-organize the behavioral sciences to best tackle these challenges.},

  abstract = {Direct observation is one of the most widely used assessment procedures by school psychologists. In a survey of more than 1,000 school psychology practitioners, Wilson and Reschly (1996) found that of the 26 different types of assessment instruments listed across seven different assessment categories (e.g., ability/intelligence, social/emotional, visual/motor), structured observational methods were ranked highest in terms of frequency of use. Overall, practitioners report that they conduct more than 15 behavioral observations of student behavior during the course of a typical month. Systematic direct observation refers to observation of behavior other than behavior that has been explicitly elicited by a predetermined and standardized set of stimuli (i.e., test behavior (Salvia \& Ysseldyke, 2001)). School psychology practitioners commonly use both naturalistic and systematic direct approaches to observing student behavior. Briefly, naturalistic observation approaches refer to those observational procedures where the observer enters specific situations (e.g., a classroom) and observes all that is going on with no predetermined behaviors in mind. Here, the most common way of recording observations is to keep an anecdotal record of the behaviors that seem important to the observer. In summarizing the information, the observer provides a complete description of the many behaviors and the context in which they occurred. In contrast, systematic direct approaches to behavioral observation are distinguished by five characteristics (Salvia \& Ysseldyke, 2001). First, the goal of observation is to measure specific behaviors. Second, the behaviors being observed have been operationally defined a priori in a precise manner. Third, observations are conducted under standardized procedures and are highly objective in nature. Fourth, the times and places for observation are carefully selected and specified. Fifth, scoring and summarizing of data are standardized and do not vary from one observer to another. Both naturalistic and systematic direct approaches to observing behavior have proven useful in developing theory and practice related to the assessment and intervention of student behavior. This chapter provides an overview of (a) naturalistic observational procedures, (b) systematic direct observational procedures, and (c) observational instruments as they related to the observation of student behavior in the classroom.

However, deploying HPE algorithms in surveillance contexts raises significant privacy concerns due to the potential leakage of sensitive personal information (SPI) such as facial features, and ethnicity. Existing privacy-enhancing methods often compromise either privacy or performance, or they require costly additional modalities. We propose a novel privacy-enhancing system that generates privacy-enhanced portraits while maintaining high HPE performance. Our key innovations include the reversible recovery of SPI for authorized personnel and the preservation of contextual information. By jointly optimizing a privacy-enhancing module, a privacy recovery module, and a pose estimator, our system ensures robust privacy protection, efficient SPI recovery, and high-performance HPE. Experimental results demonstrate the system's robust performance in privacy enhancement, SPI recovery, and HPE.},

Findings from multi-level mixed models indicated teacher-child relationships were significantly associated with growth in child achievement and social skills and classroom quality was associated with problem behaviors. While race/ethnicity did not moderate the association between teacher-child relationship and classroom quality, there was evidence of racialized differences in the buffering role of classroom quality on children's achievement and behavior in the face of conflictual teacher-child relationships. The implications of the findings for promoting equitable learning opportunities for racially minoritized children are discussed.},

Adult-infant coordination at age 4 months indeed predicted both outcomes at age 12 months, but midrange degree of mother-infant and stranger-infant coordination was optimal for attachment (Strange Situation), whereas high ("tight") stranger-infant coordination in the lab was optimal for cognition (Bayley Scales). Thus, high coordination can index more or less optimal outcomes, as a function of outcome measure, partner, and site. Bidirectional coordination patterns were salient in both attachment and cognition predictions. Comparison of mother-infant and stranger-infant interactions was particularly informative, suggesting the dynamics of infants' early differentiation from mothers. Stranger and infant showed different patterns of vocal rhythm activity level, were more bidirectional, accounted for 8 times more variance in Bayley scores, predicted attachment just as well as mother and infant, and revealed more varied contingency structures and a wider range of attachment outcomes. To explain why vocal timing measures at age 4 months predict outcomes at age 12 months, our dialogue model was construed as containing procedures for regulating the pragmatics of proto-conversation. The timing patterns of the 4-month-olds were seen as procedural or performance knowledge, and as precursors of various kinesic patterns in the outcomes of 12-month-olds. Thus, our work further defines a fundamental dyadic timing matrix-a system that guides the trajectory of relatedness, informing all relational theories of development.},

  abstract = {Reflexivity is the act of examining one's own assumption, belief, and judgement systems, and thinking carefully and critically about how these influence the research process. The practice of reflexivity confronts and questions who we are as researchers and how this guides our work. It is central in debates on objectivity, subjectivity, and the very foundations of social science research and generated knowledge. Incorporating reflexivity in the research process is traditionally recognized as one of the most notable differences between qualitative and quantitative methodologies. Qualitative research centres and celebrates the participants' personal and unique lived experience. Therefore, qualitative researchers are readily encouraged to consider how their own unique positionalities inform the research process and this forms an important part of training within this paradigm. Quantitative methodologies in social and personality psychology, and more generally, on the other hand, have remained seemingly detached from this level of reflexivity and general reflective practice. In this commentary, we, three quantitative researchers who have grappled with the compatibility of reflexivity within our own research, argue that reflexivity has much to offer quantitative methodologists. The act of reflexivity prompts researchers to acknowledge and centre their own positionalities, encourages a more thoughtful engagement with every step of the research process, and thus, as we argue, contributes to the ongoing reappraisal of openness and transparency in psychology. In this paper, we make the case for integrating reflexivity across all research approaches, before providing a `beginner's guide' for quantitative researchers wishing to engage reflexively with their own work, providing concrete recommendations, worked examples, and reflexive prompts.},

Latinos are a compelling case because of (1) their size and (2) their paradoxical development: strong social competencies yet relatively weak academic development. A suggestion is to provide young Latinos with classroom experiences that resonate with the ways they are socialized at home, yet cultural dimensions of teaching in early education are underspecified and reliable and valid measures do not exist. We frame equitable teacher--child interactions as the combination of generic and cultural aspects, and as a way to utilize the social assets of Latinos in classrooms to enhance their academic development. We refine an observation protocol---the Classroom Assessment of Sociocultural Interactions (CASI)---by integrating cultural concepts from the Learning by Observing and Pitching In (LOPI) paradigm with videos of K-1 classrooms in Central Mexico, and conduct a series of psychometric analyses. We find good model fit and moderate reliability for the CASI and discuss research and practice implications to foster equitable developmental opportunities for Latino children across early education settings.},

Therefore the presentation of the Western middle-class developmental pathway in textbooks as universal is grossly neglecting the reality and the psychologies of the majority of the world' s population. First, the conception of culture as the representation of environmental conditions is presented. The level of formal education acts as organizer of social milieus that define different learning environments for children. Mainly two developmental pathways are portrayed: the Western middle-class trajectory and the traditional farmer childhood. Different developmental principles are highlighted, demonstrating systematic cultural differences in the development of a conception of the self: developmental dynamics as exemplified in early mother infant interactions, the timing of developmental milestones emphasizing cultural precocities in motor development and self-recognition, developmental gestalts in different attachment relationships and precursors and consequences demonstrating that different, sometimes contradictory behavioral patterns have the same developmental consequences with the examples of empathy development and autobiographical memory. It is argued that evaluating the development in one pathway with the principles and standards of the other is unscientific and unethical. The recognition of different developmental pathways is a necessity for basic science and a moral obligation for the applied fields.},

  abstract = {In this book J. Kelso proposes a . . . general framework within which to connect brain, mind, and behavior.  Kelso's prescription for mental life breaks dramatically with the classical computational approach that is still the operative framework for many newer psychological and neurophysiological studies. His core thesis is that the creation and evolution of patterned behavior at all levels---from neurons to mind---is governed by the generic processes of self-organization. Both human brain and behavior are shown to exhibit features of pattern-forming dynamical systems, including multistability, abrupt phase transitions, crises, and intermittency.  "Dynamic Patterns" brings together different aspects of this approach to the study of human behavior, using simple experimental examples and illustrations to convey essential concepts, strategies, and methods, with a minimum of mathematics.  Kelso begins with a general account of dynamic pattern formation. He then takes up behavior, focusing initially on identifying pattern-forming instabilities in human sensorimotor coordination. Moving back and forth between theory and experiment, he establishes the notion that the same pattern-forming mechanisms apply regardless of the component parts involved (parts of the body, parts of the nervous system, parts of society) and the medium through which the parts are coupled. Finally, employing the latest techniques to observe spatiotemporal patterns of brain activity, Kelso shows that the human brain is fundamentally a pattern-forming dynamical system, poised on the brink of instability. Self-organization thus underlies the cooperative action of neurons that produces human behavior in all its forms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

It is also shown how the way in which individuals may be in synchrony with one another can vary, and that these variations are related to their respective roles in the interaction. Some of the implications of the phenomenon of interactional synchrony are discussed.}

In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of FMs in medicine, focusing on their evolution, learning strategies, flagship models, applications, and associated challenges. We examine how prominent FMs, such as the BERT and GPT families, are transforming various aspects of healthcare, including clinical large language models, medical image analysis, and omics research. Additionally, we provide a detailed taxonomy of FM-enabled healthcare applications, spanning clinical natural language processing, medical computer vision, graph learning, and other biology- and omics-related tasks. Despite the transformative potential of FMs, they also pose unique challenges. This survey delves into these challenges and highlights open research questions and lessons learned to guide researchers and practitioners. Our goal is to provide valuable insights into the capabilities of FMs in health, facilitating responsible deployment and mitigating associated risks.},

  abstract = {The growing potential for facial emotion recognition (FER) technology has encouraged expedited development at the cost of rigorous validation. Many of its use-cases may also impact the diverse global community as FER becomes embedded into domains ranging from education to security to healthcare. Yet, prior work has highlighted that FER can exhibit both gender and racial biases like other facial analysis techniques. As a result, bias-mitigation research efforts have mainly focused on tackling gender and racial disparities, while other demographic related biases, such as age, have seen less progress. This work seeks to examine the performance of state of the art commercial FER technology on expressive images of men and women from three distinct age groups. We utilize four different commercial FER systems in a black box methodology to evaluate how six emotions - anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutrality, and sadness - are correctly detected by age group. We further investigate how algorithmic changes over the last year have affected system performance. Our results found that all four commercial FER systems most accurately perceived emotion in images of young adults and least accurately in images of older adults. This trend was observed for analyses conducted in 2019 and 2020. However, little to no gender disparities were observed in either year. While older adults may not have been the initial target consumer of FER technology, statistics show the demographic is quickly growing more keen to applications that use such systems. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering various demographic subgroups during FER system validation and the need for inclusive, intersectional algorithmic developmental practices.},

Objective               The goal of this systematic review was to understand the ways in which personalization has been used with conversational agents in health care and characterize the methods of its implementation.                                         Methods               We searched on PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and ACM Digital Library using a predefined search strategy. The studies were included if they: (1) were primary research studies that focused on consumers, caregivers, or health care professionals; (2) involved a conversational agent with an unconstrained natural language interface; (3) tested the system with human subjects; and (4) implemented personalization features.                                         Results               The search found 1958 publications. After abstract and full-text screening, 13 studies were included in the review. Common examples of personalized content included feedback, daily health reports, alerts, warnings, and recommendations. The personalization features were implemented without a theoretical framework of customization and with limited evaluation of its impact. While conversational agents with personalization features were reported to improve user satisfaction, user engagement and dialogue quality, the role of personalization in improving health outcomes was not assessed directly.                                         Conclusions               Most of the studies in our review implemented the personalization features without theoretical or evidence-based support for them and did not leverage the recent developments in other domains of personalization. Future research could incorporate personalization as a distinct design factor with a more careful consideration of its impact on health outcomes and its implications on patient safety, privacy, and decision-making.},

The analysis identified 625 genes associated with adiposity, of which 531 encode a known protein and 487 are novel candidate genes for obesity. Enrichment analyses indicated that BFM-associated genes were characterized by their higher than expected involvement in cellular, regulatory and immune system processes, and BFD-associated genes by their involvement in cellular, metabolic, and regulatory processes. Mendelian Randomization analyses suggested that the gene expression of 69 genes was causally related to BFM and BFD. Six genes were replicated in UK Biobank. In this study, we identified novel genes for BFM and BFD that are BFM- and BFD-specific, involved in different molecular processes, and whose up-/downregulated gene expression may causally contribute to obesity.},

  abstract = {N-of-1 trials are the gold standard study design to evaluate individual treatment effects and derive personalized treatment strategies. Digital tools have the potential to initiate a new era of N-of-1 trials in terms of scale and scope, but fully functional platforms are not yet available. Here, we present the open source StudyU platform, which includes the StudyU Designer and StudyU app. With the StudyU Designer, scientists are given a collaborative web application to digitally specify, publish, and conduct N-of-1 trials. The StudyU app is a smartphone app with innovative user-centric elements for participants to partake in trials published through the StudyU Designer to assess the effects of different interventions on their health. Thereby, the StudyU platform allows clinicians and researchers worldwide to easily design and conduct digital N-of-1 trials in a safe manner. We envision that StudyU can change the landscape of personalized treatments both for patients and healthy individuals, democratize and personalize evidence generation for self-optimization and medicine, and can be integrated in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Modeling dialog systems is currently one of the most active problems in Natural Language Processing. Recent advancement in Deep Learning has sparked an interest in the use of neural networks in modeling language, particularly for personalized conversational agents that can retain contextual information during dialog exchanges. This work carefully explores and compares several of the recently proposed neural conversation models, and carries out a detailed evaluation on the multiple factors that can significantly affect predictive performance, such as pretraining, embedding training, data cleaning, diversity reranking, evaluation setting, etc. Based on the tradeoffs of different models, we propose a new generative dialogue model conditioned on speakers as well as context history that outperforms all previous models on both retrieval and generative metrics. Our findings indicate that pretraining speaker embeddings on larger datasets, as well as bootstrapping word and speaker embeddings, can significantly improve performance (up to 3 points in perplexity), and that promoting diversity in using Mutual Information based techniques has a very strong effect in ranking metrics.},

  abstract = {Research on speech and language development has a long history, but in the past decade, it has been transformed by advances in recording technologies, analysis and classification tools, and AI-based language models. We conducted a systematic literature review to identify recently developed (semi-)automatic tools for studying speech-language development and learners' environments in infants and children under the age of 5 years. The Language ENvironment Analysis (LENA) system has been the most widely used tool, with more and more alternative free- and/or open-source tools emerging more recently. Most studies were conducted in naturalistic settings, mostly recording longer time periods (daylong recordings). In the context of vulnerable and clinical populations, most research so far has focused on children with hearing loss or autism. Our review revealed notable gaps in the literature regarding cultural, linguistic, geographic, clinical, and social diversity. Additionally, we identified limitations in current technology---particularly on the software side---that restrict researchers from fully leveraging real-world audio data. Achieving global applicability and accessibility in daylong recordings will require a comprehensive approach that combines technological innovation, methodological rigour, and ethical responsibility. Enhancing inclusivity in participant samples, simplifying tool access, addressing data privacy, and broadening clinical applications can pave the way for a more complete and equitable understanding of early speech and language development. Automatic tools that offer greater efficiency and lower cost have the potential to make science in this research area more geographically and culturally diverse, leading to more representative theories about language development.},

  abstract = {Increasing mental health problems among university students highlight the need for scalable, effective solutions. We have developed a transdiagnostic mobile intervention called ROOM, promoting adaptive emotion regulation (ER) skills among university students. Understanding how the intervention works and optimising content and delivery is essential for creating an effective and adaptive system. Therefore, this study aimed to optimise ROOM through a sequential explanatory mixed-methods design, combining a Micro-Randomized Trial (MRT), evaluating within-person effects using repeated randomisation, with user experience interviews. 161 university students (82\% females) participated in a 3-week MRT to assess the intervention proximal outcomes, that is, participants' positive and negative emotional states after completing intervention exercises. Additionally, we evaluated impact on distal outcomes (i.e., distress symptoms and ER skills), and user experience by combining objective (e.g., exercise completion rates) and subjective (e.g., exercise likability and helpfulness ratings) engagement patterns with insights from the semi-structured interviews (n = 18). Upon receiving the intervention, positive emotional states increased and negative ones decreased. The effect on positive emotional states gradually decreased over time while the effect on negative emotional states remained stable throughout the 3-week intervention period. Distress symptoms and ER skills either remained stable or improved over the 3 weeks, which indicated the intervention's safety. Overall, engagement patterns and interview data show that the intervention was well received, students enjoyed this study design and found context-sensitive content recommendations highly relevant.},

  abstract = {Background: Many university students experience mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. To support their mental health, a transdiagnostic mobile app intervention has been developed. The intervention provides short exercises rooted in various approaches (eg, positive psychology, mindfulness, self-compassion, and acceptance and commitment therapy) that aim to facilitate adaptive emotion regulation (ER) to help students cope with the various stressors they encounter during their time at university. Objective: The goals of this study are to investigate whether the intervention and its components function as intended and how participants engage with them. In addition, this study aims to monitor changes in distress symptoms and ER skills and identify relevant contextual factors that may moderate the intervention's impact. Methods: A sequential explanatory mixed methods design combining a microrandomized trial and semistructured interviews will be used. During the microrandomized trial, students (N=200) will be prompted via the mobile app twice a day for 3 weeks to evaluate their emotional states and complete a randomly assigned intervention (ie, an exercise supporting ER) or a control intervention (ie, a health information snippet). A subsample of participants (21/200, 10.5\%) will participate in interviews exploring their user experience with the app and the completed exercises. The primary outcomes will be changes in emotional states and engagement with the intervention (ie, objective and subjective engagement). Objective engagement will be evaluated through log data (eg, exercise completion time). Subjective engagement will be evaluated through exercise likability and helpfulness ratings as well as user experience interviews. The secondary outcomes will include the distal outcomes of the intervention (ie, ER skills and distress symptoms).~Finally, the contextual moderators of intervention effectiveness will be explored (eg, the time of day and momentary emotional states). Results: The study commenced on February 9, 2023, and the data collection was concluded on June 13, 2023. Of the 172 eligible participants, 161 (93.6\%) decided to participate. Of these 161 participants, 137 (85.1\%) completed the first phase of the study. A subsample of participants (18/172, 10.5\%) participated in the user experience interviews. Currently, the data processing and analyses are being conducted. Conclusions: This study will provide insight into the functioning of the intervention and identify areas for improvement. Furthermore, the findings will shed light on potential changes in the distal outcomes of the intervention (ie, ER skills and distress symptoms), which will be considered when designing a follow-up randomized controlled trial evaluating the full-scale effectiveness of this intervention. Finally, the results and data gathered will be used to design and train a recommendation algorithm that will be integrated into the app linking students to relevant content.

  abstract = {Reflexivity is a fundamental expectation of qualitative work in psychology (and the wider social sciences), but what it looks like and how we do it is frequently ambiguous and implicit. This makes doing reflexivity a challenging endeavor, particularly for those new to using qualitative methodologies. This article explores reflexivity as a form of critical thinking and evaluation by demarcating reflexive activity in relation to other forms of critical thinking used in psychology. Using notions of perspectival location, we shed some practical light on the objectives and processes of reflexivity, from its significance in the identification of a research topic, through designing, conducting, and writing the research report. The overarching question of ``what is the point of reflexivity?'' is answered through an interrogation of common assumptions around producing ``good'' research in psychology as well as through a series of key questions illuminating different steps in the research process. We conclude that reflexivity requires the unpacking of partial, positioned and affective perspectives we bring to the research. This process facilitates our questioning and moves us beyond our own taken-for-granted assumptions and sense-making of the social world.},

  abstract = {Objectives Competition is related to psychophysiological stress responses and is a key aspect of esports. Yet, while competition may indeed have an impact on performance, little is known about competition-related psychophysical stress responses in esports. Accordingly, this review aims to investigate whether playing esports in competitive (and non-competitive) settings is related to psychological and/or physiological stress. Design A systematic literature review was performed. Study inclusion criteria included: assessment of psychological and/or physiological stress in esports, study of healthy individuals over 12 years of age, and published in peer-reviewed journals in English or German. Method The literature search comprised EBSCOhost, PubMed, and Web of Science up until August 2019. An additional search was performed on Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Sponet. Results Seventeen studies met inclusion criteria. In publications investigating the non-competitive setting, it can be assumed that merely playing esports games is unrelated to psychophysiological stress reactions. While three out of five studies on stress in competitive settings demonstrated no hormonal reaction, one study reported an increase in anxiety levels in winners as well as an increase cortisol levels from baseline to postgame conditions, and two studies found an activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Overall, the studies revealed theoretical and methodological limitations, which are discussed in the present review. Conclusions Although the existing literature contributes to an initial understanding of psychophysiological stress in esports, further in-depth studies of stress responses in actual competition are needed.},

In 1983, 19 of these couples were contacted to determine the change in relationship satisfaction that had occurred over the preceding 3 yrs. In the present study, Ss completed questionnaires on marital satisfaction, physical health, and general information. A broadly based pattern of physiological arousal (across spouses, interaction segments, and physiological measures) in 1980 was found to predict decline in marital satisfaction; the more aroused the couple was during the 1980 interactions, the more their marital satisfaction declined over the ensuing 3 yrs. Much of the variance in marital satisfaction appeared to be encoded in the patterns of physiology and affect that occurred during the interaction. Several affective variables also predicted decline in marital satisfaction, including a pronounced sex difference in negative affect reciprocity: Marital satisfaction declined most when husbands did reciprocate their wives' negative affect and when wives did not reciprocate their husbands' negative affect.

This introduction to the special issue provides an overview of challenges to the Belmont principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice revealed in the 10 articles.

  abstract = {Social interactions are pervasive in human life with varying forms of interpersonal coordination emerging and spanning different modalities (e.g. behaviors, speech/language, and neurophysiology). However, during social interactions, as in any dynamical system, patterns of coordination form and dissipate at different scales. Historically, researchers have used aggregate measures to capture coordination over time. While those measures (e.g. mean relative phase, cross-correlation, coherence) have provided a wealth of information about coordination in social settings, some evidence suggests that multiscale coordination may change over the time course of a typical empirical observation. To address this gap, we demonstrate an underutilized method, windowed multiscale synchrony, that moves beyond quantifying aggregate measures of coordination by focusing on how the relative strength of coordination changes over time and the scales that comprise social interaction. This method involves using a wavelet transform to decompose time series into component frequencies (i.e. scales), preserving temporal information and then quantifying phase synchronization at each of these scales. We apply this method to both simulated and empirical interpersonal physiological and neuromechanical data. We anticipate that demonstrating this method will stimulate new insights on the mechanisms and functions of synchrony in interpersonal contexts using neurophysiological and behavioral measures.},

  abstract = {This survey explores the transformative impact of foundation models (FMs) in artificial intelligence, focusing on their integration with federated learning (FL) in biomedical research. Foundation models such as ChatGPT, LLaMa, and CLIP, which are trained on vast datasets through methods including unsupervised pretraining, self-supervised learning, instructed fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback, represent significant advancements in machine learning. These models, with their ability to generate coherent text and realistic images, are crucial for biomedical applications that require processing diverse data forms such as clinical reports, diagnostic images, and multimodal patient interactions. The incorporation of FL with these sophisticated models presents a promising strategy to harness their analytical power while safeguarding the privacy of sensitive medical data. This approach not only enhances the capabilities of FMs in medical diagnostics and personalized treatment but also addresses critical concerns about data privacy and security in healthcare. This survey reviews the current applications of FMs in federated settings, underscores the challenges, and identifies future research directions including scaling FMs, managing data diversity, and enhancing communication efficiency within FL frameworks. The objective is to encourage further research into the combined potential of FMs and FL, laying the groundwork for healthcare innovations.},

While existing LLMs excel at text-based inferences, health applications require that models be grounded in numerical data (e.g., vital signs, laboratory values in clinical domains; steps, movement in the wellness domain) that is not easily or readily expressed as text in existing training corpus. We demonstrate that with only few-shot tuning, a large language model is capable of grounding various physiological and behavioral time-series data and making meaningful inferences on numerous health tasks for both clinical and wellness contexts. Using data from wearable and medical sensor recordings, we evaluate these capabilities on the tasks of cardiac signal analysis, physical activity recognition, metabolic calculation (e.g., calories burned), and estimation of stress reports and mental health screeners.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have captured significant interest from both academia and industry due to their impressive performance across various textual tasks. However, the potential of LLMs to analyze physiological time-series data remains an emerging research field. Particularly, there is a notable gap in the utilization of LLMs for analyzing wearable biosignals to achieve cuffless blood pressure (BP) measurement, which is critical for the management of cardiovascular diseases. This paper presents the first work to explore the capacity of LLMs to perform cuffless BP estimation based on wearable biosignals. We extracted physiological features from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals and designed context-enhanced prompts by combining these features with BP domain knowledge and user information. Subsequently, we adapted LLMs to BP estimation tasks through instruction tuning. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conducted assessments of ten advanced LLMs using a comprehensive public dataset of wearable biosignals from 1,272 participants. The experimental results demonstrate that the optimally fine-tuned LLM significantly surpasses conventional task-specific baselines, achieving an estimation error of 0.00 \textpm{} 9.25 mmHg for systolic BP and 1.29 \textpm{} 6.37 mmHg for diastolic BP. Notably, the ablation studies highlight the benefits of our context enhancement strategy, leading to an 8.9\% reduction in mean absolute error for systolic BP estimation. This paper pioneers the exploration of LLMs for cuffless BP measurement, providing a potential solution to enhance the accuracy of cuffless BP measurement.},

While previous research suggests that hand gesture deficits are linked to depression, it remains unclear whether these deficits are state-dependent or persist beyond active illness. This study utilized an automated, video-based tool to quantify spontaneous hand gestures in individuals with current (cMDD) and remitted (rMDD) MDD during oral expression. A total of 145 participants (97 rMDD and 49 cMDD) completed a recorded gesture-elicitation task, and hand movement trajectories were extracted using video-based body tracking. Results revealed that individuals with current MDD exhibited significantly fewer gestures per minute compared to remitted individuals (p~=~.016, d~=~0.38). Furthermore, gesture frequency negatively correlated with depressive symptom severity (r~=~-0.17, p~=~.046) and observational measures of psychomotor retardation (r~=~-0.23, p~=~.012). These findings suggest that gesture deficits are more strongly tied to the active state of depression rather than serving as a marker of vulnerability or a scar from previous depressive episodes. Automated gesture analysis provides an objective and scalable method for assessing nonverbal behavior in MDD. Future research should explore its clinical utility as a biomarker for symptom severity and treatment response.},

The objective of this study was to investigate whether this misclassification also occurs with a non-verbal so-called ``culture-free'' intelligence test administered to different age groups. Method: The intelligence of a sample of healthy Moroccan children (N = 147) ages 7, 9, and 11 was assessed using the Coloured Raven's Progressive Matrices (CPM). Raw scores were used to study age differences, as well as misclassifications when applying the norms of three countries culturally different from Morocco (United Kingdom, Spain, and Oman). Results: Intelligence performance was not within the normal range when non-representative norms were applied to the Moroccan raw scores. Misclassifications accounted for a large percentage of the participants that supposedly displayed intelligence deficits, especially when applying the British norms. Up to 15.68\% of the healthy children fell within the ``intellectually impaired'' range, and up to 62.5\% fell ``below average,'' with these percentages especially higher at older ages. Conclusions: Our findings confirm that ``culture-free'' tests should be adapted to each culture and applied together with their culture's specific norms to prevent misclassification and allow for a better, unbiased neuropsychological assessment.

Purpose: This study explores the transformative journey of foundation AI models in healthcare, shedding light on the challenges, ethical considerations, and vast potential they hold for improving patient outcome and system efficiency. Notably, in this investigation we observe a relatively slow adoption of AI within the public sector of healthcare. The evolution of AI in healthcare is un-paralleled, especially its prowess in revolutionizing diagnostic processes. Results: This research showcases how these foundational models can unravel hidden patterns within complex medical datasets. The impact of AI reverberates through medical interventions, encompassing pathology, imaging, genomics, and personalized healthcare, positioning AI as a cornerstone in the quest for precision medicine. The paper delves into the applications of generative AI models in critical facets of healthcare, including decision support, medical imaging, and the prediction of protein structures. The study meticulously evaluates various AI models, such as transfer learning, RNN, autoencoders, and their roles in the healthcare landscape. A pioneering concept introduced in this exploration is that of General Medical AI (GMAI), advocating for the development of reusable and flexible AI models. Conclusion: The review article discusses how AI can revolutionize healthcare by stressing the significance of transparency, fairness and accountability, in AI applications regarding patient data privacy and biases. By tackling these issues and suggesting a governance structure the article adds to the conversation about AI integration in healthcare environments.},

Their practical success depends on the strong motivation of participants, which, in turn, translates into high adherence and reduced loss to follow-up. One way to maintain participant engagement is by sharing their interim results. Continuously testing hypotheses during a trial, known as ``peeking'', can also lead to shorter, lower-risk trials by detecting strong effects early. Nevertheless, traditionally, results are only presented upon the trial's conclusion. In this work, we introduce a potential outcomes framework that permits interim peeking of the results and enables statistically valid inferences to be drawn at any point during N-of-1 trials. Our work builds on the growing literature on valid confidence sequences , which enables anytime-valid inference with uniform type-1 error guarantees over time. We propose several causal estimands for treatment effects applicable in an N-of-1 trial and demonstrate, through empirical evaluation, that the proposed approach results in valid confidence sequences over time. We anticipate that incorporating anytime-valid inference into clinical trials can significantly enhance trial participation and empower participants.},

Objectives{$\quad$}We conducted qualitative interviews with patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction undergoing N-of-1 trials to iterate, refine, and optimize a patient-facing data visualization tool for displaying the results of N-of-1 medication trials. The goal of optimizing this tool was to promote patients' understanding of their individual health information and to ultimately facilitate shared decision-making about continuing or discontinuing their medication.      Methods{$\quad$}We conducted 32 semistructured qualitative interviews with 9 participants over the course of their participation in N-of-1 trials. The N-of-1 trials were conducted to facilitate a comparison of continuing versus discontinuing a {$\beta$}-blocker. Interviews were conducted in person or over the phone after each treatment period to evaluate participant perspectives on a data visualization tool prototype. Data were coded using directed content analysis by two independent reviewers and included a third reviewer to reach a consensus when needed. Major themes were extracted and iteratively incorporated into the patient-facing data visualization tool.      Results{$\quad$}Nine participants provided feedback on how their data were displayed in the visualization tool. After qualitative analysis, three major themes emerged that informed our final interface. Participants preferred: (1) clearly stated individual symptom scores, (2) a reference image with labels to guide their interpretation of symptom information, and (3) qualitative language over numbers alone conveying the meaning of changes in their scores (e.g., better, worse).      Conclusion{$\quad$}Feedback informed the design of a patient-facing data visualization tool for medication-related N-of-1 trials. Future work should include usability and comprehension testing of this interface on a larger scale.},

  abstract = {In psychology and the behavioral sciences generally, the use of the hierarchical linear model (HLM) and its extensions for discrete outcomes are popular methods for modeling clustered data. HLM and its discrete outcome extensions, however, are certainly not the only methods available to model clustered data. Although other methods exist and are widely implemented in other disciplines, it seems that psychologists have yet to consider these methods in substantive studies. This article compares and contrasts HLM with alternative methods including generalized estimating equations and cluster-robust standard errors. These alternative methods do not model random effects and thus make a smaller number of assumptions and are interpreted identically to single-level methods with the benefit that estimates are adjusted to reflect clustering of observations.

  abstract = {Personalized adaptive interventions offer the opportunity to increase patient benefits, however, there are challenges in their planning and implementation. Once implemented, it is an important question whether personalized adaptive interventions are indeed clinically more effective compared to a fixed gold standard intervention. In this paper, we present an innovative N-of-1 trial study design testing whether implementing a personalized intervention by an online reinforcement learning agent is feasible and effective. Throughout, we use a new study on physical exercise recommendations to reduce pain in endometriosis for illustration. We describe the design of a contextual bandit recommendation agent and evaluate the agent in simulation studies. The results show that, first, implementing a personalized intervention by an online reinforcement learning agent is feasible. Second, such adaptive interventions have the potential to improve patients' benefits even if only few observations are available. As one challenge, they add complexity to the design and implementation process. In order to quantify the expected benefit, data from previous interventional studies is required. We expect our approach to be transferable to other interventions and clinical interventions.},

The rapid growth in adoption of LMMs has been matched by a proliferation of differences in practice. Unless this diversity is recognized, and checked, the field shall reap enormous difficulties in the future when attempts are made to consolidate or synthesize research findings. Here we examine this diversity using two methods -- a survey of researchers (n~=~163) and a quasi-systematic review of papers using LMMs (n~=~400). The survey reveals substantive concerns among psychologists using or planning to use LMMs and an absence of agreed standards. The review of papers complements the survey, showing variation in how the models are built, how effects are evaluated and, most worryingly, how models are reported. Using these data as our departure point, we present a set of best practice guidance, focusing on the reporting of LMMs. It is the authors' intention that the paper supports a step-change in the reporting of LMMs across the psychological sciences, preventing a trajectory in which findings reported today cannot be transparently understood and used tomorrow.},

  abstract = {Objectives The cognitive expertise of experts has been an intriguing theme; there has been rapid growth in cognitive research related to esports. Given the close association between esports activities and cognition, esports holds promise in offering new perspectives for understanding cognitive expertise. This meta-analysis aims at quantitatively delineating the cognitive disparities between esports experts and amateurs. Methods The expert group comprised professional video game players and high-ranking players (top 1\%), while amateurs were assigned to the control group. Research studies published between January 2000 and December 2023 were systematically searched in databases. A three-level model with cluster-robust variance estimation was used to calculate the overall effect size. The moderating variables included professional level, cognitive abilities, dependent variable type, game genre, gender and age. Results A total of 15 studies containing 142 effect sizes and 1085 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The results indicated that, compared to amateurs, video game experts demonstrated superior cognitive abilities with a small effect size (Hedges' g = 0.373, 95\% CI [0.055--0.691], p = .012). The differences between experts and amateur players mainly manifest in spatial cognition and attention. Sensitivity analysis, risk of bias, and publication bias results indicated the reliability of these findings. Conclusions This meta-analysis confirms that esports experts possess superior cognitive abilities compared to amateurs, particularly in aspects of spatial cognition and attention. These can provide an effective reference for future selection and training in esports.},

We argue that in communities in which children are often segregated from adult work (as in middle-class European American communities), young children instead are often involved in specialised child-focused activities such as lessons, adult--child play (and scholastic play), and conversation with adults on child-related topics.             We examine this argument with systematic time-sampled observations of the extent of 2- to 3-year-old children's access to adult work compared to their involvement in specialised child-focused activities. Observations focused on 12 children in each of four communities: two middle-class European American communities (West Newton, Massachusetts and Sugarhouse, Utah), Efe foragers of the Democratic Republic of Congo, and indigenous Maya of San Pedro, Guatemala. West Newton and Sugarhouse children had less frequent access to work and were involved more often in specialised child-focused activities than Efe and San Pedro children.             The results support the idea that the middle-class European American children's frequent involvement in specialised child-focused activities may relate to their more limited opportunities to learn through observing work activities of their communities. It may be less necessary for the Efe and San Pedro children to be involved in specialised child-focused activities to prepare them for involvement in mature community practices, because they are already a regular part of them.},

Our analysis of academic articles from six leading psychology journals revealed a significantly lower but still very high percentage of studies from European and English-speaking nations (92\%), compared to a decade ago (95\%), largely due to more studies from Asia (6\%). Further analysis of four cognitive science of religion (CSR) journals showed how a more representative field is possible (67\% from the Western and Other region), with proportionately more studies in Latin America (4\%) and Africa (7\%) than psychology (\&lt;1\% each). Thanks to its interdisciplinary nature, CSR is in a good position to address ``WEIRD'' problems and may be able to offer psychology methodological and epistemological tools that involve diversifying sample populations, increasing ecological validity, capturing the causes and consequences of cultural variation, and developing novel methodologies. Despite the challenges, we encourage more researchers to embrace the lessons offered by CSR's history of global and interdisciplinary research. Where WEIRD identifies the populations we need to stop privileging, conducting work that is not just Worldwide, but also In Situ, Local, and Diverse (WILD) is what researchers themselves can aspire to. Just as nineteenth century ``armchair anthropologists'' were replaced by generations of ethnographers who went out into the real world to study human variation, so modern day psychologists need to conduct experiments outside the lab with suitably heterogeneous populations.},

Recent work has shown that, in contrast to nonhuman primates, human children focus more on reproducing the specific actions used than on achieving actual outcomes when learning by imitating. From 18 months of age, children will routinely copy even arbitrary and unnecessary actions. This puzzling behavior is called overimitation. By documenting similarities exhibited by children from a large, industrialized city and children from remote Bushman communities in southern Africa, we provide here the first indication that overimitation may be a universal human trait. We also show that overimitation is unaffected by the age of the child, differences in the testing environment, or familiarity with the demonstrating adult. Furthermore, we argue that, although seemingly maladaptive, overimitation reflects an evolutionary adaptation that is fundamental to the development and transmission of human culture.},

The present study describes the development of the dyadic coordination of vocalization and gaze behavior between mothers and infants over the first year of life. In addition to describing developmental trajectories of behavior, the study contributes to our understanding of dyadic coordination by investigating how different measures of coordination relate to one another and how individual behaviors relate to dyadic coordination within the vocal and gaze domains. Thirty dyads were recorded playing together with a standard set of toys when infants were 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age, and mother and infant vocalization and gaze behaviors were coded from these videos on a moment-to-moment basis. Coordination was analyzed using both cross-recurrence quantitative analysis and event-based measures of analysis. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine developmental trajectories of vocalization and gaze coordination. Results indicated that dyadic coordination of the timing of vocalization and gaze behaviors is a very early emerging phenomenon that is supported by both mothers and infants. Vocal coordination did not show developmental change over time, whereas mothers and infants became increasingly coordinated in their gaze behaviors as infants got older. Taken together, findings from this study highlight the importance of considering bidirectional and developmental influences on parent and infant behavior.

These methods aim to reduce perceptual distortions and biases that can compromise the objectivity necessary for scientific inquiry. Initially emphasized by early behaviorists like John B. Watson, the focus switched from subjective mental processes to observable behaviors, thereby enhancing the reliability of observational studies. Researchers employ techniques such as behavioral taxonomies---structured categories that define and classify behaviors---to ensure observations are clear and consistent. This process involves a habituation period, during which subjects become accustomed to the observer's presence, allowing for more natural behavior to be recorded. Validity and reliability checks, such as interobserver agreement, are essential to ensure that the defined categories accurately reflect the behaviors being studied. While observational methods provide valuable insights into behavior, they also highlight the limitations of human perception, which can influence various fields beyond psychology, such as law. The understanding that eyewitness accounts are often flawed underscores the need for caution when interpreting observational data. As this field continues to advance, there is a trend towards using automated tools to enhance objectivity and accuracy in observations.},

By integrating this tool within research practices, we aim to enhance data reproducibility and utility in social science research. Our approach draws on Design Science Research, proposing that MaskAnyone can facilitate safer data sharing and potentially reduce the storage of fully identifiable data. We discuss the development and capabilities of MaskAnyone, explore its integration into ethical research practices, and consider the broader implications of audio-visual data masking, including issues of consent and the risk of misuse.

Parallel activity occurred more often than any other; two-thirds of the children played in this manner over 33\% of the time. Cooperative play occupied from 1 to 57\% of the observations. Correlation of social participation was made with several other factors: (1) social participation is dependent to a large extent upon the age of children, (2) there is a slight relationship between intelligence quotients and the degree of social participation of individuals (.26), (3) nursery-school experience correlated with social participation scores .12.

N-of-1 trials are within-person crossover trials that hold the promise of targeting individual-specific effects. While the idea behind N-of-1 trials might seem simple, analyzing and interpreting N-of-1 trials is not straightforward. Here we ground N-of-1 trials in a formal causal inference framework and formalize intuitive claims from the N-of-1 trials literature. We focus on causal inference from a single N-of-1 trial and define a conditional average treatment effect (CATE) that represents a target in this setting, which we call the U-CATE. We discuss assumptions sufficient for identification and estimation of the U-CATE under different causal models where the treatment schedule is assigned at baseline. A simple mean difference is an unbiased, asymptotically normal estimator of the U-CATE in simple settings. We also consider settings where carryover effects, trends over time, time-varying common causes of the outcome, and outcome-outcome effects are present. In these more complex settings, we show that a time-varying g-formula identifies the U-CATE under explicit assumptions. Finally, we analyze data from N-of-1 trials about acne symptoms and show how different assumptions about the data generating process can lead to different analytical strategies.},

Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are used to model a priori causal assumptions and inform variable selection strategies for causal questions. Although tools originally designed for prediction are finding applications in causal inference, the counterpart has remained largely unexplored. The aim of this theoretical and simulation-based study is to assess the potential benefit of using DAGs in clinical risk prediction modeling.},

  abstract = {Objective Class imbalance is sometimes considered a problem when developing clinical prediction models and assessing their performance. To address it, correction strategies involving manipulations of the training dataset, such as random undersampling or oversampling, are frequently used. The aim of this article is to illustrate the consequences of these class imbalance correction strategies on clinical prediction models' internal validity in terms of calibration and discrimination performances. Methods We used both heuristic intuition and formal mathematical reasoning to characterize the relations between conditional probabilities of interest and probabilities targeted when using random undersampling or oversampling. We propose a plug-in estimator that represents a natural correction for predictions obtained from models that have been trained on artificially balanced datasets (``na\"ive'' models). We conducted a Monte Carlo simulation with two different data generation processes and present a real-world example using data from the International Stroke Trial database to empirically demonstrate the consequences of applying random resampling techniques for class imbalance correction on calibration and discrimination (in terms of Area Under the ROC, AUC) for logistic regression and tree-based prediction models. Results Across our simulations and in the real-world example, calibration of the na\"ive models was very poor. The models using the plug-in estimator generally outperformed the models relying on class imbalance correction in terms of calibration while achieving the same discrimination performance. Conclusion Random resampling techniques for class imbalance correction do not generally improve discrimination performance (i.e., AUC), and their use is hard to justify when aiming at providing calibrated predictions. Improper use of such class imbalance correction techniques can lead to suboptimal data usage and less valid risk prediction models.},

  abstract = {Silent gestures consist of complex multi-articulatory movements but are now primarily studied through categorical coding of the referential gesture content. The relation of categorical linguistic content with continuous kinematics is therefore poorly understood. Here, we reanalyzed the video data from a gestural evolution experiment (Motamedi, Schouwstra, Smith, Culbertson, \& Kirby, 2019), which showed increases in the systematicity of gesture content over time. We applied computer vision techniques to quantify the kinematics of the original data. Our kinematic analyses demonstrated that gestures become more efficient and less complex in their kinematics over generations of learners. We further detect the systematicity of gesture form on the level of thegesture kinematic interrelations, which directly scales with the systematicity obtained on semantic coding of the gestures. Thus, from continuous kinematics alone, we can tap into linguistic aspects that were previously only approachable through categorical coding of meaning. Finally, going beyond issues of systematicity, we show how unique gesture kinematic dialects emerged over generations as isolated chains of participants gradually diverged over iterations from other chains. We, thereby, conclude that gestures can come to embody the linguistic system at the level of interrelationships between communicative tokens, which should calibrate our theories about form and linguistic content.},

  abstract = {The rise of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Grok-3, has reshaped the artificial intelligence landscape. As prominent examples of foundational models (FMs) built on LLMs, these models exhibit remarkable capabilities in generating human-like content, bringing us closer to achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, their large-scale nature, sensitivity to privacy concerns, and substantial computational demands present significant challenges to personalized customization for end users. To bridge this gap, this paper presents the vision of artificial personalized intelligence (API), focusing on adapting these powerful models to meet the specific needs and preferences of users while maintaining privacy and efficiency. Specifically, this paper proposes personalized federated intelligence (PFI), which integrates the privacy-preserving advantages of federated learning (FL) with the zero-shot generalization capabilities of FMs, enabling personalized, efficient, and privacy-protective deployment at the edge. We first review recent advances in both FL and FMs, and discuss the potential of leveraging FMs to enhance federated systems. We then present the key motivations behind realizing PFI and explore promising opportunities in this space, including efficient PFI, trustworthy PFI, and PFI empowered by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Finally, we outline key challenges and future research directions for deploying FM-powered FL systems at the edge with improved personalization, computational efficiency, and privacy guarantees. Overall, this survey aims to lay the groundwork for the development of API as a complement to AGI, with a particular focus on PFI as a key enabling technique.},

Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is far less likely to predict false detections where nothing exists. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms all other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, by a wide margin when generalizing from natural images to artwork on both the Picasso Dataset and the People-Art Dataset.},

Facial analysis, one application of artificial intelligence, is increasingly used in real-word situations. For example, some organizations tell candidates to answer predefined questions in a recorded video and use facial recognition to analyze the potential applicant faces. In addition, some companies are developing facial recognition software to scan the faces in crowds and assess threats, specifically mentioning doubt and anger as emotions that indicate threats.  This study provides evidence that facial recognition software interprets emotions differently based on the person's race. Using a publically available data set of professional basketball players' pictures, I compare the emotional analysis from two different facial recognition services, Face   and Microsoft's Face API. Both services interpret black players as having more negative emotions than white players; however, there are two different mechanisms. Face   consistently interprets black players as angrier than white players, even controlling for their degree of smiling. Microsoft registers contempt instead of anger, and it interprets black players as more contemptuous when their facial expressions are ambiguous. As the players' smile widens, the disparity disappears. This finding has implications for individuals, organizations, and society, and it contributes to the growing literature of bias and/or disparate impact in AI.},

  abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed our understanding of cellular diversity, yet current singlecell foundation models (scFMs) remain limited in their scalability, flexibility across diverse tasks, and ability to natively integrate textual information. In this work, we build upon the Cell2Sentence (C2S) framework, which represents scRNA-seq profiles as textual ``cell sentences,'' to train Large Language Models (LLMs) on a corpus comprising over one billion tokens of transcriptomic data, biological text, and metadata. Scaling the model to 27 billion parameters yields consistent improvements in predictive and generative capabilities and supports advanced downstream tasks that require synthesis of information across multi-cellular contexts. Targeted fine-tuning with modern reinforcement learning techniques produces strong performance in perturbation response prediction, natural language interpretation, and complex biological reasoning. This predictive strength directly enabled a dualcontext virtual screen that uncovered a striking context split for the kinase inhibitor silmitasertib (CX-4945), suggesting its potential as a synergistic, interferon-conditional amplifier of antigen presentation. Experimental validation in human cell models unseen during training confirmed this hypothesis, demonstrating that C2S-Scale can generate biologically grounded, testable discoveries of context-conditioned biology. C2S-Scale unifies transcriptomic and textual data at unprecedented scales, surpassing both specialized single-cell models and general-purpose LLMs to provide a platform for next-generation single-cell analysis and the development of ``virtual cells.''},

This form of informal learning appears to be especially prevalent in many Indigenous-heritage communities of the USA, Mexico, and Central America, although it is important in all communities and in some schools. It contrasts with an approach that involves adults attempting to control children's attention, motivation, and learning in Assembly-Line Instruction, which is a widespread way of organizing Western schooling. This article contrasts these two approaches and considers how families varying in experience with these two approaches (and related practices) across generations may engage in them during everyday and instructional adult-child interactions.},

  abstract = {Measuring the quality of movement is a need and a challenge for clinicians. Jerk, defined as the quantity of acceleration variation, is a kinematic parameter used to assess the smoothness of movement. We aimed to assess and compare jerk metrics in asymptomatic participants for 3 important movement characteristics that are considered by clinicians during shoulder examination: dominant and non-dominant side, concentric and eccentric contraction mode, and arm elevation plane. In this pilot study, we measured jerk metrics by using Xsens\textregistered{} inertial measurement units strapped to the wrists for 11 different active arm movements (ascending and lowering phases): 3 bilateral maximal arm elevations in sagittal, scapular and frontal plane; 2 unilateral functional movements (hair combing and low back washing); and 2 unilateral maximal arm elevations in sagittal and scapular plane, performed with both arms alternately, right arm first. Each arm movement was repeated 3 times successively and the whole procedure was performed 3 times on different days. The recorded time series was segmented with semi-supervised algorithms. Comparisons involved the Wilcoxon signed rank test (p \&lt; 0.05) with Bonferroni correction. We included 30 right-handed asymptomatic individuals [17 men, mean (SD) age 31.9 (11.4) years]. Right jerk was significantly less than left jerk for bilateral arm elevations in all planes (all p \&lt; 0.05) and for functional movement (p \&lt; 0.05). Jerk was significantly reduced during the concentric (ascending) phase than eccentric (lowering) phase for bilateral and unilateral right and left arm elevations in all planes (all p \&lt; 0.05). Jerk during bilateral arm elevation was significantly reduced in the sagittal and scapular planes versus the frontal plane (both p \&lt; 0.01) and in the sagittal versus scapular plane (p \&lt; 0.05). Jerk during unilateral left arm elevation was significantly reduced in the sagittal versus scapular plane (p \&lt; 0.05). Jerk metrics did not differ between sagittal and scapular unilateral right arm elevation. Using inertial measurement units, jerk metrics can well describe differences between the dominant and non-dominant arm, concentric and eccentric modes and planes in arm elevation. Jerk metrics were reduced during arm movements performed with the dominant right arm during the concentric phase and in the sagittal plane. Using IMUs, jerk metrics are a promising method to assess the quality of basic shoulder movement.},

  abstract = {Presents a methodological critique of research paradigms in modern social psychology, particularly social cognition, taking the approach of S. Asch as a more appropriate model. The critique has 2 parts. First, it is argued that the dominant model of science in the field is appropriate only for a well-developed science, in which basic, real-world phenomena have been identified, important invariances in these phenomena have been documented, and appropriate model systems that capture the essence of these phenomena have been developed. These requirements are not met for most of the phenomena under study in social psychology. Second, the model of science in use is a caricature of the actual scientific process in well-developed sciences such as biology. Such research is often not model or even hypothesis driven, but rather relies on "informed curiosity" to motivate research. Descriptive studies are considered important and make up a substantial part of the literature, and there is less exclusive reliance on experiment. The critique are documented by analysis of articles in appropriate psychology and biology journals. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Over the last months, cases of SARS-CoV-2 surged repeatedly in many countries but could often be controlled with nonpharmaceutical interventions including social distancing. We analyzed deidentified Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking data from 1.15 to 1.4 million cell phones in Germany per day between March and November 2020 to identify encounters between individuals and statistically evaluate contact behavior. Using graph sampling theory, we estimated the contact index (CX), a metric for number and heterogeneity of contacts. We found that CX, and not the total number of contacts, is an accurate predictor for the effective reproduction number R derived from case numbers. A high correlation between CX and R recorded more than 2 wk later allows assessment of social behavior well before changes in case numbers become detectable. By construction, the CX quantifies the role of superspreading and permits assigning risks to specific contact behavior. We provide a critical CX value beyond which R is expected to rise above 1 and propose to use that value to leverage the social-distancing interventions for the coming months.},

The study identifies a previously unstudied sophisticated form of collaboration frequently used by 25 pairs of Mexican-heritage 8- to 11-year-old children and rarely used by 25 pairs of European American children. Pairs from both backgrounds spent nearly a third of the time during a computer programming activity building on each other's ideas through making and responding to proposals. However in addition, Mexican American pairs spent another third of the time coordinating in fluid synchrony, anticipating each other's contributions without proposals. This accounts for their averaging twice as much collaboration overall than the European American children, who spent more time resisting their partner's con\- tributions, negotiating whose idea to use, and bossing their partner.},

  abstract = {Background Digital health solutions and personalised medicine are rapidly evolving fields that offer significant potential for enhancing healthcare delivery, particularly in low-resource settings. N-of-1 trials, a personalised experimental approach, hold particular promise for individualised patient care and empowerment. This scoping review aims to explore the current landscape of these innovations in the context of Ghana. Objectives This review seeks to map existing literature on digital health solutions, personalised medicine, and N-of-1 trials in Ghana. It also aims to identify key themes, trends, and gaps in the literature while discussing the current role and potential of N-of-1 trials in this context as an important knowledge base for future exploration of personalised medicine and digital N-of-1 trials in low resource settings like Ghana. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar; from year 2000 to April 2024, to identify relevant studies. Inclusion criteria were studies focusing on digital health, personalised medicine, and N-of-1 trials within Ghana or similar low-resource settings. Data were extracted and analysed to identify common themes, trends, and gaps in the existing literature. Results The scoping review included 40 publications, that is, only very few studies have been published in this field that fit our objectives. The studies revealed a predominant focus on digital health solutions in Ghana, particularly mobile health (mHealth) interventions, which account for 60\% of the interventions reviewed. These solutions include mobile applications for clinical decision support, patient monitoring, and health education, and have been effective in enhancing healthcare delivery, especially in remote and underserved areas. Introducing electronic health records (EHRs) represent 24\% of the interventions and have shown promise in improving data management and patient care coordination. However, challenges such as poor network infrastructure and resistance to change need to be addressed. Personalised medicine, though less represented in the reviewed literature (7.5\%), shows promise in providing tailored treatments based on individual genetic profiles. The review did not identify any studies specifically focused on N-of-1 trials, highlighting the innovative potential for future research in this area. Conclusion The findings underscore the need for robust digital infrastructure, training for healthcare providers, and policy frameworks to support the adoption of digital health solutions, personalised medicine, and N-of-1 trials in Ghana. Addressing these gaps requires concerted efforts to enhance digital infrastructure, provider education, and supportive policies. N-of-1 trials offer substantial potential for personalised care but necessitate further exploration and integration into the healthcare system.},

  abstract = {Ergonomic risk assessment is crucial for preventing work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs), which often arise from repetitive tasks, prolonged sitting, and load handling, leading to absenteeism and increased healthcare costs. Biomechanical risk assessment, such as RULA/REBA, is increasingly being enhanced by camera-based motion capture systems, either marker-based (MBSs) or markerless systems (MCBSs). This systematic review compared MBSs and MCBSs regarding accuracy, validity, and reliability for industrial ergonomic risk analysis. A comprehensive search of PubMed, WoS, ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, and PEDro (31 May 2025) identified 898 records; after screening with PICO-based eligibility criteria, 20 quantitative studies were included. Methodological quality was assessed with the COSMIN Risk of Bias tool, synthesized using PRISMA 2020, and graded with EBRO criteria. MBSs showed the highest precision (0.5--1.5 mm error) and reliability (ICC {$>$} 0.90) but were limited by cost and laboratory constraints. MCBSs demonstrated moderate-to-high accuracy (5--20 mm error; mean joint-angle error: 2.31{$^\circ$} \textpm{} 4.00{$^\circ$}) and good reliability (ICC {$>$} 0.80), with greater practicality in field settings. Several studies reported strong validity for RULA/REBA prediction (accuracy up to 89\%, {$\kappa$} = 0.71). In conclusion, MCBSs provide a feasible, scalable alternative to traditional ergonomic assessment, combining reliability with usability and supporting integration into occupational risk prevention.},

This is the first systematic, quantitative study of children's social environment and practice in this Indigenous community. The results show that the practices of the Yurakare people are based on two things: (1) inclusion of all ages in community life, which cultivates children to engage in useful activities even while having fun; (2) the primacy of mature activities, which is in line with the LOPI model.},

  abstract = {Long-term respiratory patterns are generated by remarkably complex brain networks. Because brains are unique, we hypothesized that their dependent respiratory patterns may be similarly unique. To test this hypothesis, we developed a wearable device that precisely measures and logs nasal airflow in each nostril separately for up to 24-h periods. We found that we could identify members of a 97-participant cohort at a remarkable 96.8\% accuracy from nasal airflow patterns alone. In other words, humans have individual nasal airflow fingerprints. Moreover, in test-retest experiments, we found that these individual fingerprints remain stable over extended periods of time, such that individual identification by nasal airflow fingerprints was on par with or better than voice recognition. Finally, we find that the high sensitivity of these fingerprints provides significant indications on both physiological states, such as levels of arousal and body-mass index, and cognitive traits, such as levels of anxiety, levels of depression, and behavioral tendencies. We conclude that long-term patterns of nasal airflow reflect the brain drivers of respiration, are individually unique, and have significant implications for health, emotion, and cognition.},

(iii) critical skills included those requiring specific physical procedures (toolmaking, hide preparation (and the preparation and use of other soft materials) but also more cognitive skills like tracking, local natural history, navigation. (iv) As these more cognitive skills are not ied to\&nbsp; distinctive motor sequuencs, in-principle they cannot be learned by observing and reproducing the motor sequences of models. Even for those skills that do encompass specific physical skills, imitation of a model's specific motor sequences is at most only one aspect of skill acquisition. The importance of imitation and other copying has been much over-stated in discussions of cumulative culture. (v) Rather than imitation or some other form of copying, the crucial cognitive capacity required for cumulative culture is the ability to integrate information streams from multiple social and physical channels. (vi) The reliable transmission of the cognitive capital of one forager generation to the next is supported by an adaptive, efficient learning niche. \&nbsp;},

  abstract = {Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease with rising incidence in high-income countries. Genetic and environmental predisposing factors contribute to the etiology of the disease, although their interaction is not sufficiently understood to allow for preventive action. Strongest known associations with genetic variation map to classical HLA class II genes. Because of its genetic complexity, the HLA region has been under-represented in genome-wide association studies, having potentially hindered the identification of relevant associations underlying the etiology of the disease. Here, we performed a comprehensive HLA-wide genetic association analysis of type 1 diabetes including multi-allelic and rare variants. We used high-density whole-exome sequencing data of the HLA region in the large UK Biobank dataset to apply gene-based association tests with a carefully defined T1D phenotype (97 cases and 48,700 controls). Exon-based and single-variant association tests were used to complement the analysis. We replicated the known association of type 1 diabetes with the classical HLA-DQ gene. Tailoring the analysis towards rare variants, we additionally identified the lysine methyl transferase EHMT2 as associated. Deeper insight into genetic variation associated with disease as presented and discussed in detail here can help unravelling mechanistic details of the etiology of T1D. More specifically, we hypothesize that genetic variation in EHMT2 could impact autoimmunity in T1D development.},

There is little agreement about what constitutes strong versus weak theory in the social sciences, but there is more consensus that references, data, variables, diagrams, and hypotheses are not theory. Despite this consensus, however, authors routinely use these five elements in lieu of theory. We explain how each of these five elements can be confused with theory and how to avoid such confusion. By making this consensus explicit, we hope to help authors avoid some of the most common and easily averted problems that lead readers to view papers as having inadequate theory. We then discuss how journals might facilitate the publication of stronger theory. We suggest that if the field is serious about producing stronger theory, journals need to reconsider their empirical requirements. We argue that journals ought to be more receptive to papers that test part rather than all of a theory and use illustrative rather than definitive data.},

  abstract = {Language plays a central role in human life. However, the term ``language,'' as defined in the language sciences of the twentieth century and the traditions these have drawn on, has arguably limited our thinking about what language is and does. The two inter-linked volumes of Thibault's study articulate crucially important aspects of an emerging new perspective shift on language--the distributed language view--that is now receiving more and more attention internationally. Rejecting the classical view that the fundamental architecture of language can be localised as a number of inter-related levels of formal linguistic organization that function as the coded inputs and outputs to each other, the distributed language view argues that languaging behaviour is a bio-cultural organization of process that is embodied, multimodal, and integrated across multiple space-time scales. Thibault argues that we need to think of human languaging as the distinctively human mode of our becoming and being selves in the extended human ecology and the kinds of experiencing that this makes possible. Paradoxically, this also means thinking about language in non-linguistic ways that break the grip of the conventional meta-languages for thinking about human languaging. Thibault's book grounds languaging in process theory: Languaging and the forms of experience it actualises are always an event, not a thing that we ``use.'' In taking a distinctively interdisciplinary approach, the book relates dialogical theories of human sense-making to the distributed view of human cognition, to recent thinking about distributed language, to ecological psychology, and to languaging as inter-individual affective dynamics grounded in the subjective lives of selves. In taking this approach, Thibault's two volume study considers the coordination of selves in social encounters, the emergent forms of self-reflexivity that characterize these encounters, and the implications for how we think of and live our human sociality, not as something that is mediated by over-arching codes and systems, but as emerging from the endogenous subjectivities of selves when they seek to coordinate with other selves and with the situations, artefacts, social institutions, and technologies that populate the extended human ecology. The two volumes aim to bring our understanding of human languaging closer to human embodiment, experience, and feeling while also showing how languaging enables humans to transcend local circumstances and thus to dialogue with cultural tradition. Volume I focuses on the shorter timescales of bodily dynamics in languaging activity. Volume II connects the shorter timescales of body dynamics to the longer cultural-historical timescales of the linguistic and cultural norms and patterns to which bodily dynamics are integrated.

A theoretical framework grounded in motor control mechanisms articulating how sociocultural and biological signals converge to shape movement is currently missing. Here, we propose a framework for the emerging field of ethnokinesiology aiming to provide a conceptual space and vocabulary to help bring together researchers at this intersection. We offer a first-level schema for generating and testing hypotheses about cultural differences in movement to bridge gaps between the rich observations of cross-cultural movement variations and neurophysiological and biomechanical accounts of movement. We explicitly dissociate two interacting feedback loops that determine culturally relevant movement: one governing sensorimotor tasks regulated by neural signals internal to the body, the other governing ecological tasks generated through actions in the environment producing ecological consequences. A key idea is the emergence of individual-specific and culturally influenced motor concepts in the nervous system, low-dimensional functional mappings between sensorimotor and ecological task spaces. Motor accents arise from perceived differences in motor concept topologies across cultural contexts. We apply the framework to three examples: speech, gait and grasp. Finally, we discuss how ethnokinesiological studies may inform personalized motor skill training and rehabilitation, and challenges moving forward. This article is part of the theme issue `Minds in movement: embodied cognition in the age of artificial intelligence'.},

  abstract = {To predict and explain the behavior of others, one must understand that their actions are determined not by reality but by their beliefs about reality. Classically, children come to understand beliefs, including false beliefs, at about 4--5 y of age, but recent studies using different response measures suggest that even infants (and apes!) have some skills as well. Resolving this discrepancy is not possible with current theories based on individual cognition. Instead, what is needed is an account recognizing that the key processes in constructing an understanding of belief are social and mental coordination with other persons and their (sometimes conflicting) perspectives. Engaging in such social and mental coordination involves species-unique skills and motivations of shared intentionality, especially as they are manifest in joint attention and linguistic communication, as well as sophisticated skills of executive function to coordinate the different perspectives involved. This shared intentionality account accords well with documented differences in the cognitive capacities of great apes and human children, and it explains why infants and apes pass some versions of false-belief tasks whereas only older children pass others.},

  abstract = {We propose that the crucial difference between human cognition and that of other species is the ability to participate with others in collaborative activities with shared goals and intentions: shared intentionality. Participation in such activities requires not only especially powerful forms of intention reading and cultural learning, but also a unique motivation to share psychological states with others and unique forms of cognitive representation for doing so. The result of participating in these activities is species-unique forms of cultural cognition and evolution, enabling everything from the creation and use of linguistic symbols to the construction of social norms and individual beliefs to the establishment of social institutions. In support of this proposal we argue and present evidence that great apes (and some children with autism) understand the basics of intentional action, but they still do not participate in activities involving joint intentions and attention (shared intentionality). Human children's skills of shared intentionality develop gradually during the first 14 months of life as two ontogenetic pathways intertwine: (1) the general ape line of understanding others as animate, goal-directed, and intentional agents; and (2) a species-unique motivation to share emotions, experience, and activities with other persons. The developmental outcome is children's ability to construct dialogic cognitive representations, which enable them to participate in earnest in the collectivity that is human cognition.},

Coordination was evaluated with 2 measures: (1) matching-the extent to which mother and infant engage in the same behavior at the same time; and (2) synchrony-the extent to which mother and infant change their behavior with respect to one another. Mother-infant pairs increase their degree of coordination with infant age, but the proportion of time they are coordinated is small. Mother-son pairs spend more time in coordinated states than mother-daughter pairs. The results suggest that interactions be characterized in terms of their movement from coordinated to miscoordinated states rather than only in terms of their degree of coordination. The gender differences are discussed in terms of their importance for the developmental differences in females and males.},

Bernstein (1967) defined coordination as a problem of mastering the very many degrees of freedom involved in a particular movement---of reducing the number of independent variables to be controlled.

A second round of theory and research on Bernstein's problem is now under way. This second round is motivated by similarities between coordination and physical processes in which multiple components become collectively self-organized; it is directed at an explanation of coordination in terms of very general laws and principles. The major achievements of the first round of efforts to address Bernstein's problem are summarized, and six examples of the theory and research typifying the second round are presented.

  abstract = {Human pose estimation (HPE) from monocular RGB images has been experiencing a rapid development in the research areas of computer vision and has the benefit of being tested in several areas of application such as medicine, sports training, virtual reality, surveillance, etc. Keypoint detection of HPE is subject to many complications such as occlusion and environments with environmental background. As a solution to some of these problems, they rely heavily on marker-based models to assess human poses which rely on reflective markers and quality cameras. Regardless of quality, it will always be limited by the disruption of natural motion that reflective markers cause due to misplacement. Most recently, markerless keypoint detection models have been developed and implemented in HPE. In this research, markerless models, such as MoveNet, MediaPipe, YOLOv8, Keypoint R-CNN, and PoseNet will be evaluated by the performance of their evaluation keys across three datasets. Ground truth keypoints for these datasets were generated using a tool called KINOVEA, with manual joint position annotations serving as reference images for evaluating the five deep learning pose estimation models across three subjects performing various activities. Key evaluation metrics include PDJ, PCK, PCP, AR, MSE, RMSE, AP, and mAP. MoveNet and YOLOv8 demonstrated the best overall performance. During the ramp walk activity, MoveNet achieved the lowest PDJ (0.054) and the highest PCK (0.054), indicating strong joint localization. MediaPipe and PoseNet performed well in terms of AR for car and ramp walk activities. YOLOv8 achieved the lowest MSE (0.009) and RMSE (0.095) along with high AP and mAP values. In summary, MoveNet excels in joint localization, while YOLOv8 provides robust and efficient pose estimation across diverse scenarios.},

The authors show how mainstream scientific activity treats psychological properties as being fundamentally stable, universal, and isolable. They then challenge this status quo by inviting readers to recognize that dynamics, context-specificity, interconnectedness, and uncertainty, are a natural and exciting part of human psychology -- these are not things to be avoided and feared, but instead embraced. This requires a shift toward a process-based approach that recognizes the situated, time-dependent, and fundamentally processual nature of psychological phenomena. With complex dynamic systems as a framework, this book sketches out how we might move toward a process-based praxis that is more suitable and effective for understanding human functioning.},

This phenomenon can occur in various forms such as matching rhythmic movements, aligning speech patterns, or synchronizing biological rhythms. It plays a crucial role in social interactions, effective communication, sports, and musical performance. This work aims to reference accessible online datasets related to human synchronization, to increase their visibility and availability. Notably, it compiles 75 directly accessible datasets and 26 with indirect access to study synchronization in various contexts. It reviews all types of synchronization tasks and contexts found in the datasets. Results are clustered into four categories: discontinuous movement, continuous movement, social interactions, and musical performance. Then, this review explores the signals and acquisition methods used across human synchronization datasets, ranging from simple touchpads, and kinematic sensors, to expansive motion capture and hyperscanning technologies. This paper surveys objective measures of synchronization used in the gathered papers and reveals some heterogeneity in the quantification of synchronization. Furthermore, it points out a lack of annotated datasets, which limits the development of machine learning methods. By compiling accessible datasets, this review centralizes valuable experimental data, providing a foundation for more collaborative, comprehensive, and standardized approaches to studying human synchronization.},

In physicians, the effects of elevated stress levels exceed the individual level and include treatment errors and reduced quality of patient-doctor relationships. Breathing and mindfulness-based exercises have been shown to reduce stress and could serve as an immediate and easy-to-implement anti-stress intervention among physicians. Due to the heterogeneity of their effect on stress, we aim to evaluate the intervention effect of performing a short daily breathwork-based or mindfulness-based intervention on the everyday level of perceived stress in physicians in residence in Germany in a series of N-of-1 trials.Study participants will choose between two short interventions, box breathing, and one guided more complex mindfulness-based breathing exercise. Each participant subsequently will be randomly allocated to a sequence of 1-week intervention (A) and control (B, everyday life) phases. Each N-of-1 trial consists of two two-week cycles (AB or BA), resulting in a total trial duration of 4 weeks (ABAB or BABA). Perceived levels of stress will be assessed daily via the StudyU App on the participant's smartphone. Additionally, participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire at baseline and three months after completion of the study that contains questions about basic participant characteristics, lifestyle factors, individual living situations, and validated psychological questionnaires. Intervention effects will be estimated by Bayesian multi-level random effects models on the individual and population level.This study contributes to the development of short-term solutions to reduce work-related stress for physicians in residence. This is expected to benefit the individual and increase the quality of overall healthcare due to a reduction in treatment errors and an increase in the quality of doctor-patient relationships.Trial Registraion: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT06368791, first registered April 16, 2024.},

This paper investigated the association between depression and gait characteristics with the aim to assist in diagnosing depression. Our dataset consisted of 121 healthy people and 126 patients with depression who diagnosed by psychiatrists according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Spatiotemporal, temporal-domain, and frequency-domain features were extracted based on the walking data of 247 participants recorded by Microsoft Kinect (Version 2). Multiple logistic regression was used to analyze the variance of spatiotemporal (12.55\%), time-domain (58.36\%), and frequency-domain features (60.71\%) on recognizing depression based on Nagelkerke's R2 measure, respectively. The contributions of the different types of features were further explored by building machine learning models by using support vector machine algorithm. All the combinations of the three types of gait features were used as training data of machine learning models, respectively. The results showed that the model trained using only time- and frequency-domain features demonstrated the same best performance compared to the model trained using all the features (sensitivity = 0.94, specificity = 0.91, and AUC = 0.93). These results indicated that depression could be effectively recognized through gait analysis. This approach is a step forward toward developing low-cost, non-intrusive solutions for real-time depression recognition.},

  abstract = {Healthcare monitoring is crucial for early detection, timely intervention, and the ongoing management of health conditions, ultimately improving individuals' quality of life. Recent research shows that Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in supporting healthcare tasks. However, existing LLM-based healthcare solutions typically rely on cloud-based systems, which raise privacy concerns and increase the risk of personal information leakage. As a result, there is growing interest in running these models locally on devices like mobile phones and wearables to protect users' privacy. Small Language Models (SLMs) are potential candidates to solve privacy and computational issues, as they are more efficient and better suited for local deployment. However, the performance of SLMs in healthcare domains has not yet been investigated. This paper examines the capability of SLMs to accurately analyze health data, such as steps, calories, sleep minutes, and other vital statistics, to assess an individual's health status. Our results show that, TinyLlama, which has 1.1 billion parameters, utilizes 4.31 GB memory, and has 0.48s latency, showing the best performance compared other four state-of-the-art (SOTA) SLMs on various healthcare applications. Our results indicate that SLMs could potentially be deployed on wearable or mobile devices for real-time health monitoring, providing a practical solution for efficient and privacy-preserving healthcare.},

Second, gait recognition can be done from low-resolution videos and with simple instrumentation. Third, gait recognition can be done without the cooperation of individuals. Fourth, gait recognition can work well while other features such as faces and fingerprints are hidden. Finally, gait features are typically difficult to be impersonated.Recent ubiquity of smartphones that capture gait patterns through accelerometers and gyroscope and advances in machine learning have opened new research directions and applications in gait recognition. A timely survey that addresses current advances is missing.In this article, we survey research works in gait recognition. In addition to recognition based on video, we address new modalities, such as recognition based on floor sensors, radars, and accelerometers; new approaches that include machine learning methods; and examine challenges and vulnerabilities in this field. In addition, we propose a set of future research directions. Our review reveals the current state-of-art and can be helpful to both experts and newcomers of gait recognition.

  abstract = {How might one account for the organization in behavior without attributing it to an internal control structure? The present article develops a theoretical framework called behavioral dynamics that integrates an information-based approach to perception with a dynamical systems approach to action. For a given task, the agent and its environment are treated as a pair of dynamical systems that are coupled mechanically and informationally. Their interactions give rise to the behavioral dynamics, a vector field with attractors that correspond to stable task solutions, repellers that correspond to avoided states, and bifurcations that correspond to behavioral transitions. The framework is used to develop theories of several tasks in which a human agent interacts with the physical environment, including bouncing a ball on a racquet, balancing an object, braking a vehicle, and guiding locomotion. Stable, adaptive behavior emerges from the dynamics of the interaction between a structured environment and an agent with simple control laws, under physical and informational constraints.},

  abstract = {Digital health interventions often use machine learning (ML) models to make predictions of repeated adverse health events. For example, models may be used to analyze patient data to identify patterns that can anticipate the likelihood of disease exacerbations, enabling timely interventions and personalized treatment plans. However, many digital health applications require the prediction of highly heterogeneous and nuanced health events. The cross-subject variability of these events makes traditional ML approaches, where a single generalized model is trained to classify a particular condition, unlikely to generalize to patients outside of the training set. A natural solution is to train a separate model for each individual or subgroup, essentially overfitting the model to the unique characteristics of the individual without negatively overfitting in terms of the desired prediction task. Such an approach has traditionally required extensive data labels from each individual, a reality that has rendered personalized ML infeasible for precision health care. The recent popularization of self-supervised learning, however, provides a solution to this issue: by pretraining deep learning models on the vast array of unlabeled data streams arising from patient-generated health data, personalized models can be fine-tuned to predict the health outcome of interest with fewer labels than purely supervised approaches, making personalization of deep learning models much more achievable from a practical perspective. This perspective describes the current state-of-the-art in both self-supervised learning and ML personalization for health care as well as growing efforts to combine these two ideas by conducting self-supervised pretraining on an individual's data. However, there are practical challenges that must be addressed in order to fully realize this potential, such as human-computer interaction innovations to ensure consistent labeling practices within a single participant.},

  abstract = {During development we transition from coregulation (where regulatory processes are shared between child and caregiver) to self-regulation. Most early coregulatory interactions aim to manage fluctuations in the infant's arousal and alertness; but over time, coregulatory processes become progressively elaborated to encompass other functions such as sociocommunicative development, attention and executive control. The fundamental aim of coregulation is to help maintain an optimal `critical state' between hypo- and hyperactivity. Here, we present a dynamic framework for understanding child--caregiver coregulatory interactions in the context of psychopathology. Early coregulatory processes involve both passive entrainment, through which a child's state entrains to the caregiver's, and active contingent responsiveness, through which the caregiver changes their behaviour in response to behaviours from the child. Similar principles, of interactive but asymmetric contingency, drive joint attention and the maintenance of epistemic states as well as arousal/alertness, emotion regulation and sociocommunicative development. We describe three ways in which active child--caregiver regulation can develop atypically, in conditions such as Autism, ADHD, anxiety and depression. The most well-known of these is insufficient contingent responsiveness, leading to reduced synchrony, which has been shown across a range of modalities in different disorders, and which is the target of most current interventions. We also present evidence that excessive contingent responsiveness and excessive synchrony can develop in some circumstances. And we show that positive feedback interactions can develop, which are contingent but mutually amplificatory child--caregiver interactions that drive the child further from their critical state. We discuss implications of these findings for future intervention research, and directions for future work.},

  abstract = {Physiological systems are best characterized as complex dynamical processes that are continuously subjected to and updated by nonlinear feedforward and feedback inputs. System outputs usually exhibit wide varieties of behaviors due to dynamical interactions between system components, external noise perturbations, and physiological state changes. Complicated interactions occur at a variety of hierarchial levels and involve a number of interacting variables, many of which are unavailable for experimental measurement. In this paper we illustrate how recurrence plots can take single physiological measurements, project them into multidimensional space by embedding procedures, and identify time correlations (recurrences) that are not apparent in the one-dimensional time series. We extend the original description of recurrence plots by computing an array of specific recurrence variables that quantify the deterministic structure and complexity of the plot. We then demonstrate how physiological states can be assessed by making repeated recurrence plot calculations within a window sliding down any physiological dynamic. Unlike other predominant time series techniques, recurrence plot analyses are not limited by data stationarity and size constraints. Pertinent physiological examples from respiratory and skeletal motor systems illustrate the utility of recurrence plots in the diagnosis of nonlinear systems. The methodology is fully applicable to any rhythmical system, whether it be mechanical, electrical, neural, hormonal, chemical, or even spacial.},

Most universities in the U.S. have ``openness in research'' policies to ensure academic freedom to publish freely, exercised by retaining university control of data. Here, we describe our study of cultural ecosystem services in the St. Louis River estuary region (Nagaajiwanaang in the language Ojibwemowin) in Duluth, Minnesota, and Superior, Wisconsin, U.S., an area that includes portions of the 1854 and 1842 Ceded Territories and reservation lands of a local band of Ojibwe (hereafter referred to as ``the Band''). In this university-led, Band-supported study, both the university and the Band sought ownership of data collected based on their respective policies, resulting in a research delay of nearly a year. We found that open research policies that do not consider Indigenous sovereignty can hamper collaboration between university researchers and tribal nations, even when there is broad agreement on research goals and objectives. University open research policies that do not explicitly address Indigenous sovereignty fall short of the open research principles they intend to support and should be revised. Formal adoption of principles for ethical research with sovereign tribal governments by universities is needed to improve coordination and trust among university and tribal researchers and members.},

Hence, it is not surprising that there have been tremendous efforts made to understand team learning within the past two decades. These efforts, however, have produced a cluttered literature-base that overlooks a fundamental aspect of team learning: How do teams learn over time? In this paper, we first synthesize the literature to develop a shared vocabulary to understand team learning dynamics. We then leverage research investigating how teams operate within the context of time (e.g., team development, performance cycles, emergent state development) and combine it with the extant team learning literature in developing an unfolding model of team learning. This comprehensive model addresses a noticeable gap in the extant literature by illustrating how teams learn over time. Finally, we put forth three grand challenges for the future of team learning research.},

This chapter enacts the phenomenon of collaborative creativity through a mathematical characterization of coordination dynamics in terms of transfer entropy and prediction decay. It uses extant datasets from a dyadic mirror game and study on musical improvisation. The chapter provides a comparison of coordination dynamics in two improvisational settings: a movement-based improvisation known as the mirror game and a dyadic musical improvisation on a digital keyboard. Although it investigates coordination in two empirical dyadic contexts, it sets the stage for further work that can scale up to larger groups. To do so, the chapter employs methods that can apply to multiple data modalities and that prior work has applied beyond the dyadic (or bivariate) level. It envisions that the key to this is understanding interpersonal coordination in terms of information flow and signal predictability. The chapter concludes with a discussion of some unanswered questions to set the stage for future research that investigates the role of coordination dynamics in collaborative and creative contexts.

This multiscale coordination should play a functional role in facilitating effective collaboration. To evaluate this, we conducted a study of computer-based CPS with 42 dyadic teams. We used cross-wavelet coherence to examine movement coordination, extracted from videos, at several scales, and tested whether the observed coordination was greater than expected due to chance and due to task demands. We found that coordination at scales less than 2s was greater than chance and at most scales (except 16s, 1m, and 2m), was greater than expected due to task demands. Lastly, we observed that coherence at .25s and 1s scales was predictive of performance. However, when including relative phase, our results suggest that higher in-phase movement coordination at the 1s scale was the strongest predictor of CPS performance. Further, we used growth curve modeling to examine how movement coordination changes across the duration of the task and whether this is moderated by CPS performance. We found that coordination over the duration of the CPS task is quadratic (a U shape) and that better performing teams have higher coordination with a shallower curve. We discuss these findings and their relevance to understanding how low-level movement coordination facilitates CPS.},

To support such complex interactions, recent efforts have worked toward the design of adaptive human-autonomy teaming systems that can provide feedback in or near real time to achieve the desired individual or team results. However, while significant advancements have been made to better model and understand the dynamics of team interaction and its relationship with task performance, appropriate measures of team coordination and computational methods to detect changes in coordination have not yet been widely investigated. Having the capacity to measure coordination in real time is quite promising as it provides the opportunity to provide adaptive feedback that may influence and regulate teams' coordination patterns and, ultimately, drive effective team performance. A critical requirement to reach this potential is having the theoretical and empirical foundation from which to do so. Therefore, the first goal of the paper is to review approaches to coordination dynamics, identify current research gaps, and draw insights from other areas, such as social interaction, relationship science, and psychotherapy. The second goal is to collate extant work on feedback and advance ideas for adaptive feedback systems that have potential to influence coordination in a way that can enhance the effectiveness of team interactions. In addressing these two goals, this work lays the foundation as well as plans for the future of human-autonomy teams that augment team interactions using coordination-based measures.},

In this study, we present StudyMe, an open-source mobile application that is freely available from https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=health.studyu.meand offers users flexibility and guidance in configuring every component of their trials. We also present research that informed the development of StudyMe, focusing on trial creation. Through an initial survey with 272 participants, we learned that individuals are interested in a variety of personal health aspects and have unique ideas on how to improve them. In an iterative, user-centered development process with intermediate user tests, we developed StudyMe that features an educational part to communicate N-of-1 trial concepts. A final empirical evaluation of StudyMe showed that all participants were able to create their own trials successfully using StudyMe and the app achieved a very good usability rating. Our findings suggest that StudyMe provides a significant step towards enabling individuals to apply a systematic science-oriented approach to personalize health-related interventions and behavior modifications in their everyday lives.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing medical artificial intelligence, offering revolutionary changes in health care. These models excel in natural language processing (NLP), enhancing clinical support, diagnosis, treatment, and medical research. Breakthroughs, like GPT-4 and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer), demonstrate LLMs' evolution through improved computing power and data. However, their high hardware requirements are being addressed through technological advancements. LLMs are unique in processing multimodal data, thereby improving emergency, elder care, and digital medical procedures. Challenges include ensuring their empirical reliability, addressing ethical and societal implications, especially data privacy, and mitigating biases while maintaining privacy and accountability. The paper emphasizes the need for human-centric, bias-free LLMs for personalized medicine and advocates for equitable development and access. LLMs hold promise for transformative impacts in health care.},

  abstract = {Studying individual causal effects of health interventions is important whenever intervention effects are heterogeneous between study participants. Conducting N-of-1 trials, which are single-person randomized controlled trials, is the gold standard for their analysis. As an alternative method, we propose to re-analyze existing population-level studies as N-of-1 trials, and use gait as a use case for illustration. Gait data were collected from 16 young and healthy participants under fatigued and non-fatigued, as well as under single-task (only walking) and dual-task (walking while performing a cognitive task) conditions. As a reference to the N-of-1 trials approach, we first computed standard population-level ANOVA models to evaluate differences in gait parameters (stride length and stride time) across conditions. Then, we estimated the effect of the interventions on gait parameters on the individual level through Bayesian repeated-measures models, viewing each participant as their own trial, and compared the results. The results illustrated that while few overall population-level effects were visible, individual-level analyses revealed differences between participants. Baseline values of the gait parameters varied largely among all participants, and the effects of fatigue and cognitive task were also heterogeneous, with some individuals showing effects in opposite directions. These differences between population-level and individual-level analyses were more pronounced for the fatigue intervention compared to the cognitive task intervention. Following our empirical analysis, we discuss re-analyzing population studies through the lens of N-of-1 trials more generally and highlight important considerations and requirements. Our work encourages future studies to investigate individual effects using population-level data.},
